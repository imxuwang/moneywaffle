Second grand-aunt didn\u2019t speak Mandarin, only Teochew, and her vocabulary still belonged to an older era. Over the phone, she asked me where I was staying\u2014\"which inn or guesthouse \"\u2014so that my uncle could pick me up. I replied that I was staying at a \"homestay.\" She didn\u2019t understand. \"Where exactly?\" she asked. I thought of saying \"Airbnb,\" but figured she wouldn\u2019t know the term and that I couldn\u2019t possibly explain the English address to her over the phone. I had no choice but to say, \"I\u2019m staying at a friend\u2019s place; I\u2019ll come to you.\" Second grand-aunt gave me an address and told me to ask around if I couldn\u2019t find it: \"Just ask for Aunt E.\" I agreed repeatedly. Near the bustling Siam Square shopping district in Bangkok, I flagged down a taxi. \"To the Grand Palace,\" I said. Truth be told, I hadn\u2019t memorized the exact address second grand-aunt had given me. She spoke in Teochew, and I wasn\u2019t sure what characters corresponded to her words. I only caught the street name \"Song Wat Road\" and a house number, but the alley name and specific details became a blur in my mind. Sitting in the cab, I looked out the window at the familiar Lingnan-style buildings: three- to four-story homes rising vertically, old metal shutter gates on the ground floor, and storefront signs with Chinese characters. It looked so much like Chaoshan (my ancestral hometown) that I nearly forgot I was in Bangkok. My original plan was to walk to second grand-aunt\u2019s place after arriving at the Grand Palace. But while checking the map in the cab, I realized her home was still far away from there. Song Wat Road, an eight-kilometer stretch, runs southeast from the Grand Palace through Chinatown, then follows the Chao Phraya River southwest. I don\u2019t remember exactly how I negotiated with the driver, but after several adjustments to the destination, I handed him the phone to speak directly with second grand-aunt. When we finally reached the spot, the driver grinned and charged me an extra 100 baht. This was Bangkok\u2019s Bang Kho Laem district, near the iconic Ferris wheel of Asiatique, the riverside night market. On the streets, luxury hotels, high-rise condos, and modest houses alternated. The driver pointed to an alley and said, \"It\u2019s here.\" At the alley entrance, I asked an older man in Teochew, \"Uncle, is Aunt E here?\" He looked a bit surprised. \"Aunt E? Oh, Aunt E!\" Then he stood up and said he\u2019d take me to her. After walking just a few steps, I saw Aunt E approaching, supported by a middle-aged man. That was our first meeting. She had a head of silver hair, wore glasses, and had a string of beads around her neck. She looked much thinner than in photos. That year, she was 83 but still full of energy, clear-minded, and warmly conversational. The alley was narrow, only about two meters wide. After walking a few steps in, we passed a small temple at a corner, with red Chinese characters on bamboo lanterns hanging on either side. Deeper into the alley, at the far end, was Aunt E\u2019s home. Aunt E is my second grand-aunt, Grandpa\u2019s second eldest sister. In 1946, Aunt E boarded a ship to Siam (Thailand) from Shantou with her father, elder sister, and younger brother. There were too many people fleeing famine, so her mother and youngest brother (my grandpa) couldn\u2019t get on the ship. From that point on, the family was split in two, separated by the heavens and the earth. Some stayed in Siam, while others remained tied to Tangshan (a traditional term for China). Why did she leave? Why Siam? What event or moment finally made her decide to go? For those granted different choices by fate at the same time, how did their lives diverge in two lands? Did those who left ever regret their decision? Did those who stayed behind ever resent the unfairness of it all? Did they think of reuniting, or of returning? And how did they eventually reconnect? These questions flooded my mind, intense and unrelenting. I decided to seek answers. I traveled to Thailand and also returned to my ancestral hometown. Some questions have faded into the dust with the passing of the older generation, but others have allowed me to glimpse how the threads of our family\u2019s fate were tangled and stretched over time. Those Who Left Aunt E and her family lived in a rural village at the border of Puning County and Jieyang County. Before moving back to the village, they had been living in a nearby small town. However, the house they were staying in was reclaimed by its owner, leaving them with no choice but to return. By that time, their ancestral home had already been passed down to the family of the third brother, leaving Aunt E and her family to sleep in a corner of the living room. Her father, known as Zai-Niang, was a farmer who sold vegetables to make a living. He was the second brother in his family, with elder and younger brothers named Zi-Niang and Zai-Fu. Interestingly, in Teochew (Chaozhou) dialect, Zi-Niang translates to \"woman.\" It is said that before the eldest son was born, the family faced many tragedies with infant mortality, particularly with male children, while female infants survived. In response, they began giving their sons feminine names, believing it might ensure their survival. However, Zai-Niang's youngest brother did not follow this tradition, as by then, the other three sons had already survived. Such gender-biased traditions were not uncommon in rural Teochew villages. In 1931, Puning County recorded 266,400 males but only 195,800 females\u2014a stark gender imbalance. When exactly Aunt E left, my grandfather didn\u2019t know. In fact, he never even met her. For many Teochew people, Siam (modern Thailand) wasn\u2019t a far-off, unreachable place. It frequently appeared in proverbs and folk songs, such as \u201cFrom Siam to the pig trough\u201d or \u201cIf you\u2019ve got nothing, go to Siam.\u201d Another common song went: \"The Siam ship, on distant waters, Who knows if we\u2019ll live or die today. If you don\u2019t make a living abroad, You\u2019ll die a ghost in despair.\u201d Siam wasn\u2019t just a foreign land\u2014it was also a place where kinship and bloodlines offered a lifeline. For centuries, from the red-hulled junks to steamships, all kinds of people\u2014merchants, sailors, craftsmen, laborers, pirates, fugitives, and refugees\u2014sailed south to the vast expanse of Nanyang (Southeast Asia). By 1955, about 1.297 million Teochew people lived in Thailand, comprising 56% of the country\u2019s total Chinese population. The destinies of Teochew and Siam have long been intertwined. In 1767, a man of Teochew heritage, King Taksin, established the Thonburi Kingdom in Siam. Following his rise, Teochew merchants flourished in the region, gaining economic privileges, such as controlling the import of Siamese rice. Teochew plantation owners in Siam also recruited large numbers of workers from their hometown, while Teochew craftsmen were employed by the monarchy to help construct the capitals of Thonburi and Bangkok. In later decades, natural disasters and poverty continued to drive people away from Teochew. But migration was also spurred by violence and social disorder. Teochew was considered a particularly volatile frontier, beyond the full control of China\u2019s central government. The region was rife with clan feuds, resource disputes, opium smuggling, and gang activity. In 1869, the Qing government launched a pacification campaign along Teochew\u2019s coast, arresting and executing thousands of so-called \u201ctroublemakers,\u201d burning villages, and forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes. This destruction normalized large-scale male migration, particularly to Siam. War and political instability further embedded violence into the lives of ordinary people. Between 1918 and 1931, approximately 1.577 million people left Shantou port for Southeast Asia, with 868,000 going to Siam. Migration surged during tumultuous years\u2014such as 1927, when 222,000 people left Shantou, and 1928, when another 212,000 followed. These spikes coincided with the Nationalists defeating warlords and suppressing communists in the Hailufeng region. By comparison, only 84,000 people left Shantou in 1926. The exact moment when Aunt E\u2019s family made their decision to leave remains unclear. Perhaps it was a long, bleak day. County records only hint at the cascading disasters they faced before departure: prolonged warfare, droughts, floods, and famines. In late 1942 through early 1943, Guangdong suffered from severe winter and spring droughts. The early rice harvest failed. Starving villagers raided food stores, and horrifyingly, there were even reports of cannibalism. In Puning County alone, about 100,000 people either starved, fell ill, or fled. Over 70% of farmland was affected, spanning 360,000 acres. In neighboring Jieyang County, 68,400 people starved to death, 22,300 young girls and infants were sold, and 24,200 people fled to nearby provinces. Cholera outbreaks followed, killing 400 people in the nearby town where my grandfather\u2019s family lived. Meanwhile, Japanese occupation exacerbated the famine by restricting fishing and halting grain imports. During this famine, my grandfather, less than a year old, was taken by his great-grandmother to a wealthy family. Enchanted by his fluffy hair and cuteness, they considered adopting him. In the end, however, she couldn\u2019t bear to part with him and brought him back. Folk songs from this period preserve the collective memory of hunger: \"Millet weed, millet weed, Eat it, vomit it back up\u2026 No grain for the farmers, Hunger forces them to eat millet weed.\" In 1946, Aunt E\u2019s family decided to leave. Her father, Zai-Niang, pawned their four acres of farmland to pay for the journey. On the way to Shantou, he was beaten and robbed of some of the money after taking a wrong turn near customs. Furthermore, with so many refugees, tickets for the ship to Siam were allocated by lottery. The family decided that the father would take his 16-year-old and 12-year-old daughters and his 8-year-old son to Siam first. The mother and youngest son (my grandfather) would follow later. But they never reunited. After traveling to Shantou with funds sent by relatives in Siam, they were told the port was now restricting entry to \u201cnewcomers.\u201d My grandfather\u2019s mother\u2019s illness\u2014a contagious eye condition\u2014might also have prevented them from boarding. These barriers reflected Siam\u2019s tightening immigration policies. Starting in the 1920s, Siam introduced measures to assimilate its Chinese population while imposing restrictions on new arrivals. Entry taxes, literacy requirements, and bans on those with diseases like trachoma made it increasingly difficult for poor laborers and women to immigrate. These restrictions intensified after World War II as the Thai government sought to control the surge of refugees. In the end, Siam became a far-off place my grandfather and his mother could never reach\u2014a distant land forever just out of reach. Ah Ai Grandma's name was Ah Ai. I am deeply curious about her. What kind of person was this grandmother who raised her son alone? How did she live her life in Chaozhou, relying only on her son? I also wonder what Ah Ai looked like. Unfortunately, no photos of her remain. According to my grandfather, she had an oval face, thin eyebrows, a slender build, and wore her hair in a round bun at the back of her head. She often dressed in loose traditional garments. Unable to board the ship, Ah Ai and her young son returned to their hometown. As a widow with a child, they were bullied by villagers and had to move around, eventually staying at her sister\u2019s house. Her sister\u2019s home was near the riverbank of the Rongjiang River, where many children enjoyed swimming. However, Ah Ai was strict with her son, only allowing him to bathe by the river but forbidding him to go into deeper waters. When it was time to come back, she would call him home. As a result, while the neighboring children all learned to swim, her son never did. Her husband sent money monthly from overseas to support their living expenses. On many nights, under the dim candlelight, Ah Ai would process gold foil paper for extra income. Her son, still young, would sit nearby and keep her company. Sometimes, when his eyes became heavy with sleep, she would tap his head gently to keep him awake. During holidays, she would take him to the temple to worship or go watch performances in front of the local theater. Ah Ai was hesitant to go overseas even when her daughter, born in Thailand, offered to send her travel funds. This does not seem to align with the image of Ah Ai my grandfather described. He said Ah Ai was \"strong-minded.\" Her mental arithmetic amazed others. In the past, scales were measured in units of 16 taels per jin (a Chinese pound), and converting taels to jin was not straightforward. Ah Ai could calculate with ease, ensuring no one shortchanged her. Neighbors even asked her to help calculate prices when buying goods from street vendors. After the liberation of China, it became almost impossible for Ah Ai and her son to emigrate. Her husband sent back enough money for them to buy a house, so they no longer had to live with her sister. Life remained frugal. In the mornings, she would cut a single green olive in half, dip it in soy sauce, and share it with her son along with some porridge. A childhood friend of hers, who lived nearby, often came over to chat. The four acres of land that she had pawned off years ago to afford travel expenses were eventually redeemed. Ah Ai began to grow vegetables, often heading to the fields at dawn to harvest string beans. There were countless women like Ah Ai in the Minnan and Guangdong regions\u2014women who stayed behind in their hometowns while their husbands went overseas to seek livelihoods. Before the early 20th century, very few women migrated to Southeast Asia. Their husbands went alone, leaving them behind to care for their families. Some women who did manage to go overseas were drawn into human trafficking or the sex industry. From 1882 to 1892, only 2-3% of Chinese immigrants to Siam were women. This rose to under 10% before World War I, and by 1945-1949, women accounted for 31.45% of Chinese immigrants. It was not uncommon for husbands who left their hometowns to remarry abroad. A 1980s study in three counties in Fujian found that of 165 Southeast Asian immigrants, 19 workers had remarried locally after initially marrying back home\u2014a figure believed to be conservative due to the reluctance of families to disclose the truth. Meanwhile, the wives left behind lived as if they were widows. Some were tightly controlled by their families, limiting their participation in social life. The gender inequality was stark\u2014women who had extramarital affairs were seen as family disgraces, and their husbands even published notices in newspapers accusing them of being unfaithful before divorcing them. The Marriage Law introduced by New China in 1950 encouraged some of these women to seek divorce. A March 1954 report from the Guangdong People\u2019s Court\u2019s Eastern Branch recorded 74 cases of overseas Chinese marriage disputes in Puning County that year. Nearly a third of the divorces were due to the husbands remarrying abroad, another third were because of long separations, and some cases involved pregnancies from extramarital relationships or brides who had only seen their husbands in photos but never met them in person despite years of marriage. In such cases, divorces were granted if the husband had been missing for years or had remarried, and attempts at reconciliation failed. If the husband maintained correspondence and financial support, the decision depended on specific circumstances, such as the couple\u2019s feelings, the length of separation, and the level of financial support. However, the Marriage Law sparked discontent among overseas Chinese. Since remittances from overseas were a crucial source of foreign currency for China, in April 1954, the government issued a directive: If the overseas husband had not remarried, maintained correspondence, and sent remittances, the wife\u2019s request for divorce should be discouraged. Officials were instructed to mediate and persuade the wife to abandon the idea of divorce. Ah Ai\u2019s circumstances were different from others. She spent more than 20 years with her husband and decided to take her child to Siam to rebuild their life together. Although they faced obstacles, she continued to strive for a reunion. During their ten years apart, her husband sent monthly remittances, and they kept in touch through letters. Had life continued in this steady, uneventful way, it might not have been so bad. But in 1956, ten years after her husband and child had left, Ah Ai lost her eyesight. It was said to be glaucoma, but no doctor she consulted could cure it. Her young son, who was in sixth grade at the time, dropped out of school to care for her and took over her gardening work. He sold sweet potatoes to families who ground them into starch and carried vegetables to sell in the streets. It was during this time that he learned how to cook. After a year, he returned to school and made up for a missed semester. That same year, he failed his entrance exams for junior high school and decided to study on his own at home for another year. His fifteenth year slipped away in a routine of caring for his mother, growing and selling vegetables, and self-studying. In 1958, he successfully passed the entrance exam for Jieyang County No. 2 Middle School. He was a diligent student. During meals, he would draw unsolved geometry problems on the wall and study them while eating. Sometimes, inspiration struck, and his eyes lit up. Suddenly, he would put down his bowl. \"Brother, are you full?\" Ah Ai would ask in surprise. \"Not yet, I just thought of a solution!\" One day that year, while digging sweet potatoes in the field as usual, the village cadres came by and said, \u201cBrother, once these sweet potatoes are dug up, you won\u2019t be planting here anymore.\u201d He asked why. \u201cThe land will be collectivized,\u201d they replied. Embarrassed, he left and never returned to farming. Satirical folk songs about the false promises and exaggerations of the collectivization period were common at the time: \u201cThe house beams are large, one acre yields ten thousand; The communal kitchens scatter, the first meal swears oaths.\u201d \u201cThis year\u2019s bumper harvest, food rations are snatched; Surpassing the UK and the US, millet is made into water.\u201d The middle school also set up a communal kitchen where students had to eat, but he had no memories of the communal meals\u2014he had to return home to care for his blind mother. He was already used to being alone. After school, he went straight home, never participating in extracurricular activities with classmates. He didn\u2019t play basketball or table tennis. He rarely smiled, his face always stern. Because he looked \"intimidating,\" no one dared to bully him, and he had no conflicts with others. However, when it came time to join the Communist Youth League, the class League members rejected him, saying, \"You don\u2019t follow the collective path; you refuse to eat at school.\" \u201cI really had no choice,\u201d my grandfather said with a chuckle as he recalled this. \u201cThey counted it as a shortcoming and didn\u2019t let me join.\u201d After 1958, due to the Great Leap Forward and collectivization, overseas Chinese households were mobilized to turn over their assets. Remittances from overseas dropped significantly. Faced with domestic hardships and material shortages, overseas Chinese began sending rice, oil, and other goods instead of money. To secure foreign exchange, the Chinese government declared that after joining people\u2019s communes, personal living supplies, remittances, and savings of overseas Chinese families would remain privately owned. Later, policies allowing the purchase of goods with remittance vouchers were implemented, and special supply stores for overseas Chinese were established. These stores were abolished in 1966 and only reinstated in 1976. Bad news from afar arrived during this time. In August 1959, Ah Ai\u2019s husband passed away in Bangkok. Her son, seeing the red remittance letter with the obituary written in pencil, decided to keep the news from her. Until the day she died, Ah Ai never knew about her husband\u2019s death. Ah Ai's health deteriorated in the spring of 1961. During the second semester of his third year in junior high, during every recess, her son would rush home to brew herbal medicine and prepare lunch. He often had to fetch doctors to treat her and prescribe medicine. After lunch, he would return to school for the afternoon classes. In early June of that year, on a quiet evening, Ah Ai passed away without a sound. Her son finished preparing dinner and went to call her to eat, but she didn\u2019t respond. Panicking, he ran out of the house and sprinted through the village to find his third uncle and his wife. Together, they hurried to the town. He then wove through countless winding alleys to reach the riverside and informed his maternal aunt. There was no formal funeral. Everything was done quietly, with no one daring to make a fuss. It was the era of the Four Olds campaign. Even the wealthy refrained from holding funerals, let alone those who were poor. The neighborhood committee director helped apply for a free coffin, and Ah Ai was buried in a mound of earth in her husband\u2019s village. From sixth grade to his final year of junior high, her son had cared for his blind mother for nearly five years. When asked about her cause of death, he said, \"It was probably malnutrition, edema. At that time, life in the country was hard economically.\" After Ah Ai's death, her son began attending evening classes at school. Returning home after class, he would sleep for a few hours, wake up around 2 a.m., light a kerosene lamp, and study until dawn before heading back to school. This routine repeated every day. He performed well in his graduation exams, ranking second in the year for physics. The top scorer was a girl from the same village who went on to high school and later married into another area. Her son, however, was two years older than his peers. He was over the age limit to apply for a regular high school and wasn\u2019t allowed to take the exams. Instead, he enrolled in Jieyang Normal School. After his father\u2019s death, the remittance letters began being signed by his elder brother, and later by E-jie (his older sister). However, he later discovered that his elder brother had never sent money. Initially, it was their eldest sister who sent the funds\u2014she had borrowed money from their father and, after his death, decided not to repay it directly to her younger brother. Instead, she sent it under their elder brother\u2019s name to support his education. E-jie eventually took over and sent even more. Once the eldest sister\u2019s debt was \"repaid,\" E-jie began sending 30 Hong Kong dollars a month, which he exchanged for 12.81 RMB. She often encouraged him to study diligently. In her letters, she wrote, \u201cStudy hard. I won\u2019t get married yet. Once I\u2019m married, I might not be able to support you.\u201d E-jie once sent him a black-and-white photo of herself to his school. She looked elegant and fashionable, with short curly hair, fine arched eyebrows, crescent-shaped eyes, and adorned with ornate earrings, a necklace, and a lace-trimmed dress. Like Ah Ai, she had single eyelids and small eyes. \"So refined,\" her son said years later, still admiring her in the photo. He also sent E-jie a photo of himself, taken in his early twenties. He had thick eyebrows and big eyes, wearing a sweater and jacket. The brown wool was purchased from the Overseas Chinese Store. \u201cThat was when I looked dashing,\u201d he said with a smile. In 1964, he graduated and was assigned to teach at a rural elementary school. \u201cAt that time, people were so enthusiastic. The country needed us, and that was our aspiration\u2014to follow assignments without question,\u201d he said, laughing. With his job secured, he immediately wrote to his sister, telling her she no longer needed to send money. The Cultural Revolution soon began. Having overseas connections became a liability, so he burned many remittance letters. Communication between them dwindled, eventually stopping almost entirely. \"There was hardly any contact after that,\" he said. Aunt E In the place where I was born, people were accustomed to stories of migrating to Southeast Asia. Relatives of ours in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand were casually mentioned in idle chatter at the tea table. Those who returned home to visit family were called fan ke (returning guests), and they would bring gifts from faraway places to distribute among the waiting mouths. The overseas Chinese hospital in the town, as well as the elementary school where my grandfather later taught, were both donated by fan ke who had been away from home for many years. For a long time, I knew very little about my relatives in Thailand. What kind of people were they? What kind of work did they do there? What neighborhood did they live in in Bangkok, and who lived there? Had they ever had a better life? Filled with curiosity and questions, I went to Thailand. In 2017, I remember arriving at E-jie's house step by step, and the beautiful distant place I had imagined began to slowly crumble. Under the eaves of E-jie's house, there were many ants, crawling around the shoes, some even climbing onto them. Inside, the lighting was dim, the decoration was simple, and the furnishings were old. Leftover food was covered with a plastic food cover on the table. In her old age, due to diabetes, her eyesight had deteriorated somewhat, and my grandfather gave me some money to pass on to her for medical treatment. Whenever Thailand was mentioned, my grandparents would always bring up E-jie, saying how much money she sent to support my grandfather\u2019s living expenses. E-jie treated my grandfather very well, and we all knew that. Because of this, I had a special feeling for her. Although I had never met her, I naturally wanted to get close and learn more about this woman who shared my bloodline. From my one-sided perspective, E-jie\u2019s old age seemed less than ideal. I heard comments from others expressing sympathy and regret for her fate, feeling that she had struggled and wasn't truly happy. Her life was summed up in a few simple words of lament. E-jie used to sell vegetables in Da Le and worked until she was 60. She never had children but adopted a boy from another country, an infant who had been abandoned at birth. A few years later, she divorced. One day, I ran into her adopted son. We couldn\u2019t communicate due to the language barrier, and after a brief, somewhat awkward exchange, he left. At that time, I felt sadness for E-jie\u2019s past and present. A woman who had already left but was still giving, and her difficult life\u2014selling vegetables in the market, raising her younger brother from afar. Did she sacrifice her own intimate relationships and happiness by waiting for him to graduate before marrying? I had thought this way until I visited Thailand again this year. This summer, I went back to Thailand and stayed at Ren Bo\u2019s house. Ren Bo is the second son of my eldest aunt. The first time I visited Bangkok, I had also met him at E-jie\u2019s house. Ren Bo was born in 1962. From the age of seven, he helped E-jie sell vegetables after school. He was probably the youngest relative who spent the most time with E-jie and was the closest to her. He was always by her side as a child, running errands for her. As he grew up, the elders praised him for being thoughtful and kind to others. From Ren Bo\u2019s stories, I glimpsed a small corner of E-jie\u2019s life and unexpectedly discovered another side of her\u2014stories I had never heard before. \u201cShe is a kind, sports-loving person who likes to buy things for others,\u201d Ren Bo\u2019s translation app told me when I asked about E-jie. Ren Bo grew up speaking Chaozhou dialect with the elders and speaking Thai with his brothers and friends. He hasn\u2019t spoken much of either language lately, and his Chaozhou dialect has become quite rusty and less fluent. Sometimes, when he doesn\u2019t know how to express something, he opens Google Translate. He presses the \u201cmicrophone\u201d button, hesitates for a few seconds, carefully thinks about what he wants to say, afraid he won't express it clearly. But after waiting too long in silence, the microphone stops recording before he can speak. E-jie lived close to my eldest aunt, just a few minutes away. Every day, she would go to the market nearby to sell vegetables, having her own stall. Around 9 a.m., she would take someone\u2019s car to buy the goods. Two hours later, she would call out, \u201cThe vegetables are here!\u201d and Ren Bo and his uncle would come out to unload the vegetables from the car, then use a small cart to push them to the market. After that, Ren Bo would help E-jie arrange and prepare the vegetables at the stall. At 1 p.m., E-jie would open the stall on her own. She smiled a lot, and when business was good, there were many customers. Between two and three in the afternoon was the busiest time. She probably took after her mother\u2019s \u201cstrong spirit,\u201d talking a lot, loving to chat, and speaking Thai fluently. Ren Bo said she was \u201ctalkative\u201d and \u201cstrong in speech.\u201d His eldest aunt also sold vegetables, but she didn\u2019t talk much\u2014quiet, with a neutral expression, and her business wasn\u2019t as good. In my grandmother\u2019s memory, E-jie was very strong-willed. She once told my grandfather that the second sister was very \u201cwild,\u201d stubborn, while the eldest sister was honest. When they were young, the eldest and second sisters would go gather tree leaves to bring home for fuel. One day, they encountered two boys about their age in the village. A fight broke out, and they ended up using rakes to hit each other, scattering in all directions. The eldest sister had been sick as a child and now walked with a limp, too scared to move as the fight ensued. But the second sister beat the two boys so badly that they cried out loud. Even though her own hands were bruised, she didn\u2019t cry. Afterward, she sat quietly, her face dark and silent, not saying anything. The boys' mother came to their house, accusing the second sister of causing a bump on her son's head. My grandmother didn\u2019t back down either. She took the second sister out and said, \u201cThis is a matter between the children, don\u2019t come looking for trouble. Look at mine\u2014she didn\u2019t cry even though her hands were bruised.\u201d \"(In Siam), we used to sell vegetables, and the business was good. All the vendors were Chinese,\" Ren Bo said. He used traditional terms to refer to different groups: the Chinese were called \"Tang people,\" the Thai were \"foreigners,\" the Malays were \"Hakka,\" and Westerners were \"red-haired.\" By five or six in the evening, when the crowd had thinned out and E-jie was tired, she would return to her elder sister\u2019s house to rest. \"Ren, come help Auntie sell vegetables.\" Ren Bo got off school around three in the afternoon and would watch the stall until seven. After closing, he would sweep away the vegetable leaves, and E-jie would pack up the unsold vegetables into baskets, adding frost water. I misunderstood and thought she said \"sour water\"\u2014what was that? I didn\u2019t understand. \"Ice, little pieces, the vegetables stay cool. In the past, there was no freezer,\" Ren Bo explained. I realized it was referring to ice water and refrigerators. Frost water, freezer\u2014terms I had never used before. Ren Bo recalled that E-jie used to make seven or eight Thai baht a day from selling vegetables. After closing the stall, she would give him one or two baht as pocket money, which he would use to buy food. Two baht could buy a bowl of pig\u2019s feet rice, two bowls of rice noodle soup, or four skewers of grilled pork. \"Money was worth a lot back then, now the rice noodles cost forty or fifty,\" Ren Bo remarked. Ren Bo smiled and said that E-jie was relatively well-off and often helped his elder sister and younger brother. He also knew that E-jie sent money to my grandfather. \"Business was good, so she sent money to Tangshan,\" he added. But he also said, \"E-jie wasn\u2019t very rich, just somewhat well-off.\" Wealth, according to Ren Bo, was measured by food: \"Whatever you want to eat, she can get it.\" \"I\u2019d go to her place to get food,\" Ren Bo laughed. He had six siblings, and he was the second oldest. \"At our house, there were two dishes for eight people; at her house, three dishes for three or four people.\" Wherever they went, whatever they wanted to eat, Ren Bo would take E-jie along. How should I describe my feelings when I first learned this news? Surprise, relief, and a deep sense of comfort? E-jie\u2019s life was not as difficult as I had imagined. The money sent back to Tangshan wasn\u2019t squeezed out of her, either. Thank goodness. At that moment, I was almost at a loss for words, only feeling a mix of shock and joy. No one knew exactly when E-jie got married. Ren Bo recalled that when he was five, she was already married, but he couldn\u2019t remember anything earlier. From the information he could piece together, she probably got married between the ages of 30 and 33, which would have been between 1964, the year my grandfather graduated from normal school, and 1967, when Ren Bo was five and able to remember things. E-jie\u2019s husband had a son with his ex-wife, who occasionally came to E-jie\u2019s house for meals, and Ren Bo had met him. A few years after they married, E-jie left that man. Ren Bo said the man was selfish and had other women. E-jie decisively divorced him. Afterward, she had other boyfriends. Ren Bo recalled that when he was five, he used to get into trouble with people, even messing around at E-jie\u2019s vegetable stall. \"She was selling vegetables, hadn\u2019t even started, and I went over to ask for money, saying, \u2018Aunt, I want to buy something to eat.\u2019 She scolded me, saying, \u2018I haven\u2019t even sold anything yet, and you want money.\u2019\" A few years later, when Ren Bo matured, he began helping E-jie sell vegetables. E-jie was always willing to satisfy his needs. Every year during the holidays, Ren Bo would ask E-jie for new clothes, and she would buy them for him to wear. Near the vegetable stall, someone sold crispy coconut milk, which Ren Bo liked, so E-jie would tell him to buy an egg and have the vendor add it to the milk, making it taste even better. Sometimes, after selling the vegetables, Ren Bo would want to watch a movie, and E-jie would take him on a three- or four-stop bus ride to the cinema. She loved watching Chinese and Thai films. \"David Chiang (Jiang David), do you know him? From Hong Kong,\" Ren Bo asked me. I shook my head. \"Didn\u2019t you take your uncle or third uncle?\" I asked. Ren Bo laughed. \"No, they didn\u2019t like to watch those kinds of films. My uncle wasn\u2019t interested; he wouldn\u2019t go.\" After finishing middle school, Ren Bo wanted to attend a public business college. Public colleges were cheaper, while private ones were much more expensive. E-jie said that if he didn\u2019t pass the entrance exam, she would pay for him to go to a private one. She knew that his eldest aunt\u2019s family couldn\u2019t afford that much. Fortunately, Ren Bo passed the exam and was able to attend a public college, so E-jie didn\u2019t have to provide extra money. In the summer of 2017, five months after I visited E-jie, my family went to Thailand, including my 75-year-old grandfather. It was his second trip to Thailand; his first had been in 1999. When E-jie saw the whole family arrive, she was so happy that she couldn\u2019t stop smiling. My grandfather said that it was clear her joy was genuine. At that time, E-jie was still talkative. My grandfather gave her money for medical expenses again, and not long after returning to China, E-jie was hospitalized. In December of that year, E-jie passed away in Bangkok. Arrival in Siam Ren Bo stared at a black-and-white photo for a long time. Several women, dressed in white short-sleeve tops and black pants, stood in front of a newly erected tombstone, still without an inscription. It was the grave of Zai Niang (Grandmother). \"They were all neighbors,\" Ren Bo suddenly remembered, pointing to each person and saying: \"This one is my friend's grandmother; this one, she sells duck rice noodles, our neighbor; this one, I used to call her 'Drama Aunt,' but later she stopped acting and started selling chicken, duck, and pork; this one, an old lady, a kind person, when we were poor and had little to eat, she sold salted food in Daxi and brought some to us.\" They were all neighbors of Zai Niang. \"The locals all say that Grandpa (Zai Niang) was an honest person,\" Ren Bo had told me when I first arrived. He added, his friend's father had also said that Zai Niang had a kind heart and was a good person. The photo was brought by Gu Jing, the daughter of Ren Bo\u2019s father. In Chaoshan, I called her \"A Jing Gu,\" but after coming to Thailand, I followed the local custom of placing the name after the title, so I referred to her as \"Gu Jing.\" Gu Jing found a large red iron box at home, filled with many old black-and-white photographs. Before coming, she had told me via WeChat that she wanted to give me some of her husband's old photos. \"Bring him to his homeland,\" she had said in Chaozhou dialect. Gu Jing was beautiful; I had seen her photo when I was a child. In the picture, she held a bouquet of flowers, wearing a black graduation gown, standing between her parents, smiling brightly. It was clear her hairstyle had been carefully done, with two small curls of hair hanging down on each side. There was another photo where she wore a light-colored suit and had neatly cut short hair. In these photos, she was always surrounded by flowers, trees, and golden buildings, which took me, a child of less than ten, into a glamorous world I had never known. I secretly admired the refined, mature adults and envied a world that wasn\u2019t mine. \"If you have any questions, just ask us,\" Gu Ying said. She was Gu Jing's older sister, six years older than her. I had also seen Gu Ying in photos before; one was from a wedding where she married a Thai-born Chaozhou man. Gu Ying spoke some Chaozhou dialect, and in the past, when their family spoke it, Gu Ying followed along, but now she had forgotten much of it. Whenever I asked a question, Gu Ying and Ren Bo would rack their brains to answer me in Chaozhou dialect. Then they would discuss the true answer in Thai, a language I couldn\u2019t understand. After figuring it out, they would tell me. If no one knew how to express something, they would leave it to Gu Jing, who spoke Chaozhou and some \"red-haired\" (foreign) language, or they would turn to Google Translate. Ren Bo's uncles and aunts were born after Zai Niang had passed, so what they knew and spoke was mostly what they had heard from the older generation. However, now most of the elders had also passed. Many past events, like the \"famine in Tangshan,\" \"no food,\" and \"hardship,\" were vaguely summarized. No one knew the finer details of how the family had first found a place to live or made a living. Only a few scattered memories allowed me to roughly understand what had happened a long time ago. In 1946, after spending almost a month on the ship, Zai Niang and her three children finally arrived in Bangkok. That was probably the first time they saw the sea. They had lived in the inland area of Chaoshan, where there were only hills, rivers, and farmland. But the excitement of seeing the sea might have quickly been overshadowed by seasickness and hunger. They drank water until their stomachs swelled, and then they were so hungry that they fell into a deep sleep, losing track of day and night. Once they reached Bangkok, others advised that they should smoke a bit to relieve the swelling. Gu Ying also heard that some people had died of hunger on the ship and were thrown into the sea. When they first arrived in Bangkok, they had no home. Zai Niang\u2019s family lived with relatives. Gu Jing added that it was a shelter. She gestured with her hands and then pointed outside the glass door at a small overhanging area that provided shelter from the rain. \"It\u2019s not inside their (relatives\u2019) house, it\u2019s the place outside,\" Gu Ying explained. Zai Niang found a new livelihood by carrying goods to sell duck eggs. Everyone called her \"Egg Seller Uncle.\" Later, the family moved out of the relative's house and into a wooden house by the river. In order to send money back to Tangshan, Zai Niang lived frugally and often ate porridge with melon strips. \"In Siam in the past, whatever you wanted to do, there was always a way. But in Tangshan, there was no way,\" Ren Bo said. Grandpa was only eight years old when he first arrived in Siam. It\u2019s unclear when exactly, but at some point, he started selling ice cakes on the street. He never went to school and was mocked by others as a hooligan. At fourteen or fifteen, he worked as an employee at a printing factory, and by the age of nineteen, he started his own printing business. Because he couldn\u2019t read, he had to hire someone to choose the characters for printing and arrange the work. Grandpa learned Thai gradually from his friends, neighbors, and relatives, and by old age, when he spoke, he sounded like a \"Thai person.\" When Grandpa visited Thailand to see his relatives, he was still in the printing business. I read about the prosperous Bangkok of that time in the novel Southern Wind Blows Dreams by the Chinese-Thai author Mudan. Cars, cinemas, telephones, and televisions\u2014confronted with the splendor of the 1950s in a foreign land, would he have been dazzled? Perhaps, like the male protagonist in the book, he believed that hard work and endurance could change his fate. The protagonist said: \"Even now, they (Thai people) don\u2019t like doing business. They\u2019re content with whatever work, as long as they have enough to eat. They don\u2019t strive to accumulate more money like we Chinese do, so most of the people doing business are Chinese.\" \"Chinese people came here and worked hard,\" Ren Bo said, echoing the sentiments of the protagonist in the book. He thought the Thais were lazy. \"Siamese people are not like Tangshan people, they\u2019re lazy.\" Ren Bo shared his opinion, believing that the Thais of the past were not industrious and liked to rest. \"But now, Grandpa doesn\u2019t know,\" he added with a silly smile, continuing, \"Chinese people, foreigners, not necessarily.\" He said, now many Chinese are wealthy and come to Thailand to do business... to do what? Ren Bo couldn\u2019t find the right words in Chaozhou dialect. His translation app told me: some of them engage in illegal work. He was referring to telecom fraud. \"Write a letter, send two baht, tell the child not to gamble, to work the farm, raise pigs, and wait until I earn enough to return to Tangshan and reunite with the family.\" Did Zai Niang ever miss her hometown? Was she curious about the changes in her homeland? Was she satisfied with her new life abroad? Grandpa said that around 1953, Zai Niang had planned to bring her three children back to Chaoshan, but the trip never happened, as they heard that China and Thailand had severed diplomatic ties. Life in Thailand wasn\u2019t stable when they first arrived. After the return of the Luang Phibun government in 1948, they continued to pressure the Chinese, including raising the foreigner residency fee from 20 baht to 400 baht. In 1952, during discussions about increasing the fee, many Chinese protested. On June 13 of that year, over 10,000 poor Chinese gathered to demonstrate. Additionally, the government sought to eliminate the influence of communism in Thailand, launching a three-month campaign in November 1952 to arrest leftist figures. The Chinese community was also divided over which Chinese political party to support, making the local social climate unstable. On a day in August 1959, Zai Niang had a stomachache and went to the hospital. After a day or two, she passed away. Auntie said it was probably cancer, as the symptoms were similar, but at the time, it wasn\u2019t diagnosed. However, Grandpa had heard different versions. He said that Zai Niang was selling duck eggs outside someone\u2019s house when the property was demolished by the government, leaving her with nowhere to go. She became so upset that she fell ill and never recovered. He couldn\u2019t remember where he heard it from, but perhaps it was mentioned by a distant relative in the 1980s when they returned to Thailand. \"This is really it, so many years later, so far away, it\u2019s been 65 years. Those people have all passed away, and there\u2019s no one to confirm it,\" Grandpa said when I shared another version of the story with him. \"When you went to Thailand, didn\u2019t you ask about Zai Niang?\" Grandpa didn\u2019t like to dig too deeply into the past. Whenever I asked him such questions, he would just laugh and say, \"I\u2019m not a reporter.\" Auntie and the others were also curious about the past in Tangshan. Gu Ying asked me, \"Is your hometown Jieyang? Do you have a photo of your grandmother (A Ai)? How old was she when she passed? After she passed, did Grandpa live alone?\" I said yes. She widened her eyes, her mouth slightly open, probably surprised since she hadn\u2019t heard much about Grandpa living alone in the past. Fractured Memories Grandpa just celebrated his eighty-third birthday, and signs of aging are accelerating. In the summer, the days are long. By 5:30 PM, the sky is beginning to brighten. Grandpa hops onto his bicycle, rides to the Rongjiang River, leisurely circles around the nearby village, and then returns to town. It\u2019s about a ten-kilometer route, and he arrives home around seven. His arms have become weaker, and while cycling, his flesh sags down, as if it were stuck, swaying with each pedal. One evening after dinner, he went out for a walk wearing a sleeveless shirt, and someone familiar remarked that he had become thinner. Grandpa knew it himself. The next time he went out, he would wear a short-sleeved shirt over his white vest. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you? Mind your own business,\u201d I told Grandpa, suggesting he respond like that. He laughed heartily, put on the shirt, and went out again. I know that in this small town full of social norms, it\u2019s impossible to respond like that face-to-face. I can imagine Grandpa scratching his white hair, pretending not to care, smiling awkwardly, and then walking away. Grandpa has shrunk, it\u2019s true. He used to be about 1.64 meters tall, but now he\u2019s only 1.58. His sensitivity to the sound of rain has also decreased. Recently, it\u2019s been raining a lot in the afternoons. The sound of rain against the window outside the dining table goes unnoticed by him. After a few minutes, when the sound of raindrops hitting the windowsill is clear, he always exclaims with certainty as if he\u2019s the first to notice something new: \u201cIt\u2019s raining!\u201d Before I moved away from Chaoshan at the age of twelve, we lived together with Grandpa and Grandma. In our home, Grandpa handled the chores like buying groceries, cooking, and hanging laundry. He was also the one who helped me with math problems, listened to me recite my lessons, and signed my test papers\u2014because he was easy to talk to. Occasionally, if I couldn\u2019t memorize something, he would agree to sign the paper first, then remind me to memorize it properly in private, and all I had to do was pray that I wouldn\u2019t be called on by the teacher the next day. Grandpa had a good temper and a gentle personality, but he rarely smiled in public. He always looked serious, and sometimes stubborn. After becoming a teacher, even his students were surprised by him. Grandpa said he commanded respect without saying a word: he never got angry or yelled, and his students would quietly listen in class. Some colleagues punished students for talking by making them squat next to the podium, while others slammed their desks in anger. \u201cThrowing desks and chairs is wrong,\u201d Grandpa would say slowly. When he was training as a teacher, and a student spoke out of turn in class, he would tap the desk with his fingers. Afterward, his mentor criticized him, saying it was \"a form of corporal punishment\" and \"violated teaching regulations.\" I think Grandpa definitely carries some of Grandma A Ai\u2019s traits. Or rather, the experience of depending on his mother shaped his personality. So, what about the family members who have passed? After all these years, what have they left behind for Grandpa? How does he face and process those past memories of growing up without a father or siblings? Do they still exist in Grandpa\u2019s memory? Can he remember them? How much does he recall? Time, with its sharp claws, devours Grandpa\u2019s memories. He says he no longer remembers the children\u2019s stories. But through repeated prodding and persistent efforts, the floodgates to his childhood memories were suddenly cracked open a little. Grandpa remembers that during the Lunar New Year, he sat on his father\u2019s shoulders, and the family walked to the fields by the river outside the village to watch a dragon dance. This was probably the last New Year they spent together before they parted ways. Later, in the 1980s and 1990s, houses were built on that land. Grandpa also bought land and built a house there, with the door facing the river. Nowadays, the dragon dance still takes place in that village during the Lunar New Year, but the newly built high-rise buildings block the view of the sky, and standing by the river, one can no longer see the dragon dance. In the summer, Grandma carried him outside the village to catch golden beetles on the leaves of the mallow plants. There was also a night when he was hungry, and the house had no food. Grandma carried him to the garden to pick sweet potatoes and brought them back to cook soup. The sky was dark, and he sat at the edge of the garden, watching his father digging. One time, his older sister squatted in the corner to cook, and he went over to tug on her braid. Another time, he tried to pick leaves from a potted plant, and his older brother tapped him on the head with his finger. These remaining memories are mostly fragments\u2014isolated moments, tiny, broken pieces of light that can no longer be pieced together. These memories spilled out when he saw a photo of his older sister. He said he didn\u2019t recognize the teenage version of her, and he had no recollection of her face. If he bumped into her on the street, he wouldn\u2019t know it was his sister. Grandpa remembers a few small things about his father, older sister, and older brother, but he has forgotten about his beloved second sister\u2019s childhood. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more.\u201d Grandpa couldn\u2019t remember anything else. If it weren\u2019t for seeing his father\u2019s portrait years later during a trip to Thailand, even his father\u2019s face would have become blurry in his mind. **Grandpa always speaks calmly and reservedly about the past, rarely expressing himself passionately. I don\u2019t know if he intentionally suppresses his emotions about distant relatives. In general, for people from Chaozhou, suppressed emotions are often reflected in how they refer to their parents. There is a saying that fortune-tellers advise against being too familiar in one\u2019s address. As a result, many older Chaozhou people don\u2019t call their parents \u201cDad\u201d or \u201cMom,\u201d but use terms like \u201cA-Bai\u201d (father\u2019s side) and \u201cA-Mu\u201d (mother\u2019s side), or \u201cA-So\u201d (uncle) and \u201cA-Shen\u201d (aunt), which are terms for extended family members. Grandpa is the same. One thing is certain: the role of his father in Grandpa\u2019s life is distant. Grandpa doesn\u2019t know his stepmother\u2019s birth year. I asked, \u201cWhen was Grandma born?\u201d Grandpa replied, \u201cShe was born in the Year of the Goat.\u201d In this region, where ancestor worship and fortune-telling are common, older generations of Chaozhou people are accustomed to using the zodiac signs to refer to people\u2019s ages. When talking about someone, they rarely ask for the year, instead asking about their zodiac sign. Some people who like to buy lottery tickets might ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s his zodiac sign?\u201d when an unfamiliar guest visits, and they would then bet on that sign or its corresponding number. Some even study the mysterious patterns in the black-and-white tabloids, hoping to decipher the secrets. Grandma was surprised that Grandpa didn\u2019t know his father\u2019s age. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how old Uncle (Stepfather) is?\u201d she asked. Grandpa replied, \u201cHow would I know?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know his zodiac sign?\u201d Grandpa really didn\u2019t know his stepfather\u2019s zodiac sign. He only remembered that Grandma Ai once said she married at 18 (in the lunar age), had him at 35, and his stepmother married at 24. If Grandma Ai was born in the Year of the Goat, that would make her birth year 1907, and his stepmother would have been born around 1901, passing away at 59 in lunar years. However, in Thailand, I couldn\u2019t find confirmation of this. After much discussion, Aunties told me that his stepmother passed away at 62 lunar years, which means she was born in 1898. But the difference is not large\u2014I think it was somewhere in this range. Grandpa was studying a photo of his father, older brother, and older sister. After a long time, he chuckled softly. \u201cMy mother (Grandma Ai) used to complain about my stepfather. She\u2019d say his eyebrows were so thin, just like a pair of \u2018little eyebrows.\u2019 His two front teeth were like the teeth of a monkey. She\u2019d say his little teeth were so small, they were annoying.\u201d Grandpa smiled, his eyes turning crescent-shaped. \u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018little eyebrows\u2019?\u201d I didn\u2019t understand. \u201cIt\u2019s like a \u2018double-arched\u2019 eyebrow, but not thick,\u201d Grandpa explained. \u201cMy father had a double-arched eyebrow, but my stepfather\u2019s eyebrows were quite thick.\u201d He then recited a song that\u2019s commonly associated with women left behind by their husbands: \u201cOn the third day of the third lunar month, the soft moonlight shines, the moon hangs far in the sky; it\u2019s a moon so soft, thinking of my husband who has gone far away.\u201d In this song, the woman\u2019s heart is broken with longing, waiting for her reunion with her husband. But the man Grandma Ai talks about in the distance wasn\u2019t so positive; there was also a sense of \u201cdisdain.\u201d Grandma Ai mentioned that her husband was forgetful. While working in the garden, he would often forget tools and leave them behind. \u201cHe\u2019s such an easy-going person, very careless,\u201d Grandma Ai would say. There was a vegetable shop nearby, and the shopkeeper would often get vegetables from Grandpa\u2019s stepmother. One time, business was so good that they ran out of green onions. The shopkeeper asked Grandpa\u2019s stepmother to pick more, and she told him to go to the garden and pull up as many as he needed, then just pay the amount. But isn\u2019t it good to be honest and trusting? In Chaozhou, being too honest often results in being criticized\u2014honesty is seen as a lack of ability. There\u2019s a saying, \u201cHonesty is useless.\u201d But when these words come from Grandma Ai, is it an intentional subtlety? Is it a form of sarcasm to cover up her true feelings? Why did she say my stepfather\u2019s eyebrows were thin when they were actually thick? I can\u2019t be sure. During the time I briefly stepped away from the phone, Grandpa studied a photo of his father again. Later, I heard from a recording that he sighed and said to Grandma: \u201cMy stepfather had long ears, that\u2019s why he lived such a short life\u2014only in his fifties.\u201d I often think that if Grandpa and Grandma had gone to Thailand back then, they might not have been so lonely. Grandpa would have had his brother and sister with him, and maybe he would have been more like his sister\u2014someone who loved to laugh and chat. \u201cHave you ever thought that it would have been better if you had gone to Siam?\u201d I asked Grandpa nearly eighty years later. His gaze was fixed on the street outside, as if deep in thought, or maybe avoiding the question. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNot even once?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not that interested in Thailand,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good or bad over there. I don\u2019t know. What does a child know?\u201d Grandpa always tends to avoid the present. The sharp, blocking words from a child who didn\u2019t understand anything back then prevent me from asking further. It\u2019s hard to fathom Grandpa\u2019s inner world, his emotions about his father, and his feelings about distant places he never reached. \u201cIsn\u2019t there someone who\u2019s had it even harder than him?\u201d Grandma once shook her head, knowing Grandpa\u2019s nature. He rarely speaks about his past. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk about it to others. He keeps everything to himself.\u201d \u201cEveryone had it hard,\u201d Grandpa replied, not wanting to talk about suffering. \u201cToday\u2019s children are like this.\u201d \u201cThe big climate,\u201d Grandpa said, \u201cThe children before liberation, who had it hard? Those who suffered were few. Those who were poor became landowners after the land reform.\u201d The Rise and Fall The lives of my grandparents were not the stuff of legendary tales, not like those stories of laborers in Southeast Asia who became wealthy merchants. They were part of the hidden tide of migration to the South Seas, with no grand achievements to speak of. Fate, it seems, often teased them, eroding the lives they worked hard to rebuild and maintain. But they always made a forward choice at the moment when they could change their destiny. Perhaps the results were not always ideal, perhaps they didn't receive much grace, but they never gave up. In the year after my grandfather passed away, my uncles and aunts started to marry one by one. My uncle continued to live in the old house, while my eldest aunt and her husband moved next door. My youngest uncle presided over my grandfather's wedding and even wrote a letter to our hometown in Chaozhou to inform my grandmother and grandfather of this happy news. The woman my uncle married was a Chaozhou native born in Siam, whose parents had immigrated there years earlier. My eldest aunt's husband was also from Chaozhou, but older, by twelve years. Around 1940, he left Chenghai County, leaving behind his wife and infant son, and sailed to Siam. At that time, he was in his early twenties, working as a laborer at the docks while saving money to send back home. Twenty years later, in 1960, his hometown had become a place he could never return to, so he remarried in Bangkok with my eldest aunt. Before marriage, my eldest aunt had sold vegetables, specifically different varieties from those my aunt sold. After having children, she stayed home to care for them, having six children in twelve years. When the children grew up, she was encouraged by my aunt to go back to selling vegetables until she was in her fifties. From what I know of my uncle's life, he worked as a street vendor selling fruits, tofu, fried rice cakes, and soy milk. He changed his offerings multiple times, and only stopped at the age of 70. Now my uncle lives in a quiet residential area in the northwest of Bangkok in Nonthaburi, in a two-story house. He moved here more than two years ago. He showed me around the land in front and behind the house, introducing me to the mangoes, winter melons, bananas, sour oranges, and other plants whose names I couldn\u2019t understand in Thai. When I asked him why he chose this place, he used a translation app to tell me, \"I wanted a house with space to plant trees.\" My uncle's childhood was spent in a wooden house. Behind the house was the winding Chao Phraya River, with many mosquitoes that would slip in through the cracks in the wood. At night, while sleeping, he would stretch out his hand outside the blanket, and with a slap, he could kill ten mosquitoes. When he was a teenager, the tenants of the area were forced to leave as the land was to be used for the construction of a building or \"guesthouse.\" My aunt and her husband had to find a new place, one that wasn\u2019t too far from the school where the children had to study. After much searching, they found a house near the \"Yue\" area and signed a long-term lease. Life was difficult for them. My uncle had attended a private school that cost 100 baht per semester, but when the term started, he still hadn't paid, and the teacher called out his name. His third brother studied there for two years but couldn't afford the fees, so he had to transfer to a free temple school. There was one time when the water bill collector came to the house. Normally the bill was around 10 or 20 baht a month, but this time, for some reason, it was 120 baht, which they couldn't afford, so my aunt had to borrow money. Despite the poverty, my uncle was very clear about what was good and bad. My aunt and uncle always taught their children to work diligently and not take others' money. When he was a child, one of his Chinese friends lived in a house where they sold newspapers. He would often go there to read the papers and help watch the store. When something sold, he would put the money back into the cash box. One time, another child was caught taking money and stuffing it into his pants pocket. His friend's mother, who was watching from inside the house, scolded him, \"If you do this, you're going to get in trouble!\" Some things are timeless, connected across generations. When I asked my grandfather what my grandmother taught him, his answer was always consistent: \"Your hands and feet should be clean, and when you enter someone else's house, you shouldn\u2019t touch things without permission.\" I imagine this is what my aunt was taught at home, and later, what she passed on to my uncle. In the past, my uncle remembered that Bangkok had many parks and trees, and there weren\u2019t as many roads as there are now. His parents didn\u2019t have time to watch over him, so he and his friends would run off to play. One day, his uncle saw him out on the road and shouted, \"What are you doing here? Get inside!\" My uncle replied, \"I\u2019m with my friends.\" His uncle asked, \"Are you coming to my house? Don't you want to come?\" \"Go, go,\" he said, as he hopped on his uncle\u2019s motorcycle and left. My uncle often took his third brother out on errands. He loved picking up discarded cigarette wrappers to play with. Sometimes he would also collect scrap metal to sell, earning a couple of baht for a small bag. He started earning money when he was young, about eleven or twelve years old, when he worked part-time helping a vegetable vendor at the market. He worked for half an hour or an hour a day, earning 5 baht, which added up to 35 baht a week. Earlier, he also bought homemade ice cream from a neighbor and sold it at the market, shouting, \"Ice cream is here, ice cream!\" When he was eight or nine years old, he and his friends went to the river. A cargo ship came in, and the workers unloaded large sacks of white sugar onto the boat. Some sugar spilled on the ground, and my uncle collected it in a bag, one grain at a time. When he gathered a kilogram, he could sell it for two baht. His parents didn\u2019t know he was collecting sugar. They thought it was too dangerous and forbade him to go. One time, a neighbor caught him by the river, and when his uncle found out, he took a wooden stick and went looking for him. From a distance, my uncle and his third brother saw him coming and hurriedly hid. His uncle searched around but couldn\u2019t find them and had to leave. On one occasion, my uncle and a friend gathered 35 kilograms of sugar and sold it for 70 baht, which they split. That year, when he was nine years old, he used the money to take his third and fourth brothers to eat pig's trotter rice, which cost two baht per bowl. Normally, they couldn\u2019t afford to eat it at home, so he had to earn the money himself. After selling the sugar, he felt rich, and he told his brothers, \"We can have two bowls, it\u2019s only four baht.\" He also bargained with the owner, saying, \"Why is one bowl three baht? Give me the discount, it\u2019s too much.\" \"Two baht isn\u2019t enough, I want three baht,\" he laughed. My uncle has an innate sense of humor. Later, when I met his brothers, I realized that this humor was not unique to him. His fourth brother, who also spoke with a smile, often used \"understand\" and \"okay\" as part of his conversation to ease the atmosphere. He spoke in broken English and told me his job was simple, \"Okay?\" He laughed. \"I\u2019m old now, and my memory is outdated, understand?\" he laughed again. His wife shook her head, saying, \"Confused, what is he saying?\" Sometimes, my fourth uncle was stumped by my questions, furrowing his lips and thinking hard, looking like Donald Duck. \"I don\u2019t remember,\" he said. But when I asked him about his parents\u2019 work, he became enthusiastic and wrote down his answer on a piece of paper: \"Easy question, paper paper.\" Whenever he recalls the past, Renbo speaks endlessly, and it\u2019s hard to stop his flow of words. Even though his Teochew has become rusty, he still loves to speak it, occasionally finding the right word after a little search. Sometimes, he needs to think for a while, humming and murmuring, before the word finally comes out. When he talks about his retirement, he doesn\u2019t quite know how to express it, so he uses \"graduated\" as a substitute. At times, he doesn\u2019t understand what I ask. Once, I asked him what the second aunt did before selling vegetables. He paused, leaned in with his ear, squinted his eyes, and said, \"What\u2019s that? What\u2019s that?\" This was how Renbo always reacted when he didn\u2019t understand something. I rephrased the question: \"What did the second aunt do before selling vegetables?\" He understood and replied: \"The eldest aunt said the second aunt helped her husband sell eggs, then started selling vegetables when she was a teenager. She never went to school in Siam.\" In the past, when the older generation was still around, Renbo spoke Teochew more often. \"The second aunt spoke Mandarin, which was too difficult for me, so I just spoke back in Teochew.\" He laughed again, \"Now, I don\u2019t speak Mandarin anymore. You come, I\u2019ll speak in Teochew for you.\" These days, Renbo leads a healthy lifestyle. He avoids overly sweet, salty, or cold food. He wakes up around five or six in the morning, goes downstairs to watch TV, and drinks a cup of hot honey with sour lime. In the evening, his wife goes to dance fitness classes, and he walks around the area. He still plays soccer twice a week. After turning sixty, Renbo started receiving a government pension of 600 baht per month (around 120 RMB). \"600 baht, it\u2019s not enough for one meal,\" he said with a wry smile. In comparison, he believes a government job is very good because after retirement, you can still receive your salary, and most family education and healthcare are free. However, government salaries are low. He told me that his cousin, who works as a civil servant, has been working for eight or nine years but only earns around 20,000 baht (less than 5,000 RMB). Despite this, Renbo admires the retirement benefits for civil servants and regrets not knowing these things when he was younger. When he first graduated, he never thought about working for the government. When the government was mentioned, Renbo only thought of the police, and the family didn\u2019t know there were other government jobs available. \"Chinese people do the police work, no one likes it, they\u2019re afraid to catch thieves, because the thieves have guns, it\u2019s hard,\" Renbo said. I asked him what Chinese people liked to do back then. \"Banking and selling goods,\" he replied. In Thailand, the occupational divide between Thai and Chinese people was already taking shape by the 19th and 20th centuries: Thai people were more interested in agriculture, government, and self-employment, while Chinese people favored business, industry, finance, and mining. After junior high, Renbo studied at a business college for three more years. In the early 1980s, after graduation, he worked for half a year at Hung Lee Bank, then switched to a private company in sales, where the salary was higher. His salary started at 3,000 baht, and by the time he retired, it had risen to 60,000. After his children started working, the family\u2019s situation gradually improved. Most of Renbo\u2019s brothers worked in banking and sales. Five out of six worked in banks. Some switched careers early, and others were forced to leave during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The eldest brother graduated from business college and joined Thai Commercial Bank. In 1997, he left with a severance pay of 900,000 baht, bought a house in a neighboring province, and worked as a lawyer in the banking sector for a few years. Later, he helped his wife sell drinks at a stall in the market for twenty years, which continues today. When I saw him at the market, I almost didn\u2019t recognize him. Seven years ago, his hair was still dark, but now it is nearly all white, and his face shows signs of fatigue. He\u2019s over sixty now, and recently he decided to rest and stop working, saying, \"Enough, I can\u2019t go on.\" The third and fourth brothers are university graduates. The third brother became a lawyer after leaving the bank. The fourth brother, as Grandpa said, \"has two diplomas\"\u2014he studied two years of graduate school after completing his undergraduate degree. He worked in a bank for a short time, then switched careers to become a programmer. Ten years ago, he left the bank and started his own small business. \"Before, life was hard in Tangshan, but Siam was good. Now Tangshan is good, but Siam is bad,\" Renbo often compares the two places, lamenting the economic downturn in Thailand: \"Siam loses to Tangshan, losing, losing.\" \"Now, I don\u2019t dare to spend money freely,\" he said. When he bought a car, he used savings; when he bought a house, he borrowed money from family and friends. He didn\u2019t dare to borrow money from a bank, feeling the interest rates were too high. \"The bank\u2019s money, I\u2019m afraid of it,\" he said, \"Young people nowadays are not like that, they\u2019re not afraid of loans\u2014my cousin got married two years ago, wanted to buy a new house, and borrowed over three million baht from the bank, with a 30-year loan, paying more than ten thousand baht a month.\" Renbo is cautious with money, but he is also kind. One of his childhood friends, who was a gambler and lost all his family savings, now lives a tough life. His friend calls him once in a while, saying he has no money, and Renbo always gives him some. When Renbo was still earning a salary, he would occasionally give him 1,000 baht. After retiring, when his own income dried up, he would give him 300 or 500 baht. Renbo is loyal to old friends; his friend\u2019s family was rich in the past, and they always shared what they had with him, even giving him nice clothes without asking for anything in return. In his younger years, Renbo also gambled and lost several thousand baht. He went back to his wife and said, \"Buy whatever you want, go ahead,\" and from that time on, he didn\u2019t dare to gamble anymore. \"Stopped, scared, money is hard to earn.\" A few years ago, Renbo went to Tangshan to visit his half-brother and also saw my grandparents. When his brother\u2019s family asked him how life was in Siam, he replied, \"I can eat whatever I want, there\u2019s good food. I\u2019m not rich, but I\u2019m doing fine.\" Visitors from Afar When I was young, every New Year\u2019s Day, I could always hear my grandfather answering the phone. He would say it was a call from abroad. After the 1970s, connections with distant relatives slowly began to be re-established. Sister E occasionally sent care packages. The distant family members knew very little about each other and had each formed new families. Every letter became a precious opportunity to learn about one another\u2019s current situation. The letters were thin and pink, written in messy traditional Chinese characters, and were written by someone else on Sister E\u2019s behalf. Most of the letters were lost. The only surviving one is from January 1975, with 15 Hong Kong dollars enclosed. Sister E asked Grandpa, \u201cDo you know how old your eldest son is this year? Does he have any children now?\u201d Later, when acquaintances came back or went to visit relatives, Grandpa would ask them to bring local specialties for Sister E and her brother. Sister E never came back to Tangshan. Grandpa had mentioned it a few times, asking her to come and visit, but she never did. She would say that her legs weren\u2019t doing well. Uncle and Aunt would give the same excuse, \u201cNo money,\u201d \u201cThe children are studying, we need money.\u201d Grandpa\u2019s family has an old photo album on the third floor, and I often flipped through the pictures. The photos were taken during Grandpa and Grandma\u2019s first trip to Thailand in 1999. Although we had never met, I had already heard from the elders who these people were\u2014this was Grandpa\u2019s second sister, this was his eldest sister and brother, and that was their children. Before their trip to Thailand that year, Grandpa made his first phone call to his eldest sister\u2019s family. After talking to her, his second sister came on the line, and the two of them took turns speaking. Finally, the person on the other end said, \u201cAlright, don\u2019t talk too long, the phone is expensive.\u201d Back and forth, the conversation lasted half an hour, and Grandpa spent over a hundred yuan on the call. Grandpa didn\u2019t remember what they talked about during the call, but Uncle remembered. He would often bring it up, mimicking their tones. \u201cAh, brother, do you want to come to Siam?\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I want to come.\u201d \u201cHmm, when will you come? If it\u2019s on a good day, then it\u2019ll be very good.\u201d On the day they arrived in Thailand, Sister E, Uncle, and Aunt came to meet them at the airport. In the car, Uncle kept complaining. He would say that when he traveled to Siam by boat in the past, he was hungry, sick, and had a tough time all the way. He would add, \u201cBrother, you\u2019re lucky; you\u2019ve studied. When I went to get your fortune told, your fate was good.\u201d But Sister E didn\u2019t mention these things. That night when they arrived at Uncle\u2019s house, Grandma didn\u2019t come out to greet them. That day, Grandpa seemed a bit upset. He knew that his siblings-in-law\u2019s impression of relatives from Tangshan wasn\u2019t very good\u2014people from a poor place who hadn\u2019t seen each other in decades. Even though they were blood relatives, they were likely coming to ask for things. I could empathize with Grandpa\u2019s disappointment after arriving and could also understand Uncle\u2019s concerns and caution. \u201cTangshan,\u201d a distant hometown, one that doesn\u2019t need to give back but continues to receive benefits and gifts from wealthier places. People often imagine those who go to Southeast Asia returning in glory, while those left behind in poverty wait and envy the travelers, hoping to see the success they imagine they will bring. More than ten or twenty years ago, Uncle would often ask Aunt: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to go to Tangshan?\u201d Aunt would reply, \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t talk about it, I\u2019ll stay here. There\u2019s nothing good there.\u201d In the 1990s, Uncle returned to Chenghai to visit relatives; his mother and ex-wife were still there. His grandson was young and liked to watch TV, but there was none at home. Uncle\u2019s son said that Uncle didn\u2019t have the money to buy a TV. Hearing this, a few people who had traveled with him decided to pool some money together to buy a TV for his grandson. In the early 2000s, Uncle\u2019s son, who was from Tangshan, came to Thailand. He didn\u2019t have much money either. Uncle wanted to give him some, so he discussed with a few people and they decided to pool their money together. Although Uncle didn\u2019t have much money, he contributed about 3,000 to 4,000 baht. In the end, Uncle gave him over 10,000 baht. But Grandpa wasn\u2019t there to ask for anything. In 1999, Grandpa was 57 years old, and since they had been separated 53 years ago, he had never seen his eldest sister or brother. At that time, Grandpa had heard about his second sister\u2019s house burning down, and thinking of her kindness, he saved up some money and decided to go see her when a friend was visiting Thailand. In the past, wooden houses in Thailand would often catch fire, and when they did, entire rows of houses would burn down. Sister E\u2019s house had caught fire because of a neighbor\u2019s house. Uncle said there were two fires\u2014one in 1984 and another in 1998. Sister E\u2019s house was badly burned, and after it was all over, almost all of their belongings turned to ashes. They lost nearly everything, and Sister E suffered huge losses. Uncle bought her a refrigerator. Later, Sister E hired someone to rebuild, but the person didn\u2019t finish the work and ran off with the money. Grandpa and Grandma brought three jade bangles, one for each of their eldest and second sisters and their sister-in-law. For every grandchild they met, and even for the unmarried aunt at that time, they gave each person 100 Hong Kong dollars as a memento. They also gave Sister E some extra money under the pretext of helping her with the fire damage. Aunt accepted some, but Uncle felt embarrassed to accept anything. Uncle said directly, \u201cWhen others come here, they only want things, but you come here and want to share with others.\u201d He told Aunt, \u201cLook at my brother, he came all the way here, and now he\u2019s sharing money with others, while you only want to take my money.\u201d \u201cGoing this time, it changed his (Uncle\u2019s) point of view,\u201d Grandpa sighed. Seeing that their younger brother was doing well, Sister E was very happy. She had always worried about her little brother, who had been so small when they parted, and never knew how he had grown up. Grandpa and Grandma stayed at Aunt\u2019s house for one night. They stayed on the floor, with cloth curtains separating the spaces. The weather was hot and humid, and there was only one fan. Aunt\u2019s neighbors saw Grandpa and said he looked like their father. Most of the time, Grandpa and Grandma stayed at Uncle\u2019s house, which was more spacious. They went to many places together. Uncle and Aunt, along with Sister E, took Grandpa to temples and the beach. Uncle\u2019s second son, who didn\u2019t speak much Chaozhou, specially bought a dictionary and took it along when they went to the Royal Field Square. When Uncle returned from working abroad, he took a few elderly relatives out to eat hotpot. \u201cWhen Grandpa and Grandma came, Uncle was already in his thirties, still young,\u201d Uncle said with a smile. In front of buildings with tall spires and gleaming gold, they took many photos together, which they brought back to Tangshan. Uncle also took Grandpa to meet the daughter of Aunt\u2019s sister\u2014she had come to Siam early and had never met them before. They had originally wanted to visit the families of Grandpa\u2019s older brother and younger uncle, but since they hadn\u2019t been in contact for a long time, they couldn\u2019t find them in the end. Identity For many years, we each lived our own lives in different places. Most of the time, we did not disturb each other; but whenever we met, we treated each other with warmth and hospitality. We could be described as distant relatives, connected by blood, yet separated by language and geography. But I still feel some regret. I grew up in a small town in Chaozhou, where family and relatives were close, and interactions were frequent. Just like how Renbo often went to Aunt E's house for meals and stayed overnight at Uncle's, I too had such a childhood. Aunt E was my grandfather's closest family member, and we might have been closer, but over the long years, our relationship naturally grew distant. Even letters could not sustain or mend the bond. Renbo's family still keeps some Chinese remnants. There's a shrine to the local deity in the corner of the dining table. Every Spring Festival, Aunt E's family and several of her brothers wear red shirts with \"Happy New Year\" printed on them for a group photo, which they share in the WeChat group. Renbo\u2019s wife is a Thai, and she enjoys wearing red qipao. As for how they address each other, they still use Chaozhou dialect\u2014Aunt, Uncle, older brother, older sister-in-law, and so on. On the day Uncle Si visited Renbo\u2019s house, I overheard him call her \"Second Sister-in-law.\" But Aunt E also has many habits and customs that are unfamiliar to me. For example, Buddhism is deeply embedded in her life, and Renbo and his wife often engage in religious activities, making offerings to monks. She also follows the Thai Buddhist calendar, so whenever I ask about the year, I need to subtract 543 to get the familiar Gregorian year. Furthermore, she takes a bath twice a day; they don\u2019t use chopsticks at home, only forks and spoons; for breakfast, they eat fried rice, and they add chili to their congee. I can't help but wonder why the Chinese in Thailand integrated so quickly compared to Chinese communities in other Southeast Asian countries? There's an interesting story about a representative of the overseas Chinese who went to Southeast Asia to seek fortune. In 1810, Xu Sizhang from Zhangzhou, Fujian, went to Penang (now part of Malaysia) as a laborer, later trading in various locations, marrying a Thai woman, and eventually becoming a contractor for the tin mine taxes in the Siamese region, where he developed tin mining. Later, he was appointed by the Siamese royal family and granted an official title. His family was even given the Thai surname \"Na Lalong.\" His descendants who stayed in Thailand became Thais, while those who returned to Malaysia remained Chinese. About a hundred years ago, during the early years of the Bangkok Dynasty, wealthy Chinese elites in Siam maintained close relationships with the royal family. They became wealthy through cross-border trade, had tax collection rights, entered the bureaucracy, were granted noble titles, or even married into the royal family. Most of these tax contractors who served the Siamese elite were Chaozhou people. These upper-class Chinese were accepted by the Siamese elite and seamlessly integrated into the local political system. Meanwhile, ordinary Chinese laborers in Siam usually married local women, even if they had wives in China. The Siamese authorities were open about the identity choices for Chinese immigrants at the time. They were allowed to maintain their own cultural practices while freely adopting local customs. Mixed-race descendants could choose to identify as Chinese or Thai. The Chinese had to pay a head tax (marked with a string on their wrist and a stamp), but they were exempt from military service. Scholars have summarized that before 1910, mixed-race children with Chinese fathers and Thai mothers usually identified as Chinese, while children of mixed-race fathers\u2014whether their mothers were Thai or mixed\u2014typically identified as Thai. This means that by the third generation of Chinese immigrants, their identity and cultural affiliation were mostly Siamese. Although many Chinese had been gradually assimilated, in the early 20th century, with the acceptance of nationalism by educated Siamese elites, the spread of Chinese nationalism and communism, and Western anti-Chinese sentiment, the Siamese government began implementing a policy of Thai nationalism. This policy was intended to accelerate the assimilation of the Chinese, with external forces pushing the process. For example, the 1913 amendment to the nationality law made all Chinese born in Siam citizens of Siam. However, as Chinese migration to Siam increased after World War I, with entire families migrating together, the number of Chinese women and children also grew significantly. The number of second-generation Chinese born in Siam marrying local women decreased, slowing the pace of assimilation. As a result, after the 1930s, the Siamese elite imposed more stringent controls over Chinese language education, Chinese-language newspapers, and Chinese business practices. Numerous revisions to immigration laws restricted the entry of communists, the poor, and women. In a secret document from the National Security Council of Thailand in 1965, the government explained its goals and measures for assimilating the Chinese. The document pointed out that extreme nationalism should not be used, but rather a gentler approach should be adopted to assimilate the Chinese into loyal Thai citizens. This included encouraging intermarriage, using Thai names, offering equal rights to naturalized citizens, and establishing more Thai-language schools. These gentle policies had a direct impact on my grandfather\u2019s relatives. Today, there is almost no clear distinction between Chinese and Thai social classes in Thai society. Among the second-generation immigrants, except for Renbo, the other uncles and aunts barely speak the language of their parents. Aunt E's family no longer seeks to marry fellow Chinese as their parents did\u2014only Aunt Ying married a descendant of Chinese immigrants. By the third generation, this is even less of a concern. I am curious about how Aunt E perceives her identity and Chinese heritage. Renbo\u2019s younger brother told me that when she was a child, she had no interest in China and didn\u2019t know much about the place, except that her parents had told her it was very poor. Her parents' hometown was just a distant image to her. She couldn\u2019t speak much Chaozhou dialect and only spoke Thai at school. Her friends were all Thai. At home, she mixed the two languages, which often got her scolded by her eldest uncle: \u201cSpeak properly!\u201d The eldest uncle only knew a little Thai, and Aunt E's mother knew even less. So, when she spoke to her parents, Renbo had to act as her translator. Aunt E seamlessly integrated into Thai society and became a full-fledged Thai. On the wall near the stairs in Renbo's house, there is a picture of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej and his dog Tongda, along with another photo of his wife, Queen Sirikit. When I met her on the day she visited, she gave several yellow shirts to Renbo\u2019s family and me, with the royal emblem on the chest. Yellow is the color representing the king, and that month was the birthday month of the current king. She said, \"I can wear it when I go out to play.\" Uncles and aunts have Chinese names, but they only use them at home. Outside, for school or work, Aunt E has always used a Thai name. Renbo\u2019s former surname was \"Chen\"\u2014in fact, the eldest uncle\u2019s surname is Lin, but when he arrived in Siam, his ID card was mistakenly swapped, and upon landing in Siam, he became a \"Chen.\" From that moment on, the surname \"Chen\" was always on his and his children\u2019s identification cards. In his thirties, Renbo decided to change his surname to a Thai one. He said, \"When Chinese people come to Siam, what they need most is to change their surname\u2014just by seeing your surname, they know you\u2019re a local, not a foreigner. Locals are easier to deal with.\" Of his six brothers, three changed to Thai surnames. From 1982 to around 1990, the Thai government received about 10,000 applications per year to change surnames, 90% of which were from Chinese people; in addition, about a thousand Chinese immigrants became Thai citizens each year. Renbo selected three possible surnames and went to the district office several times to complete the paperwork. The staff rejected his requests for various reasons. On the final attempt, Renbo slipped 200 baht into the staff's hand. The staff member sighed, looking troubled yet scrutinizing the surname seriously, then said, \"This one is too common, can't use it... this one, this one is good! Just a regular one, a couple of bows, and it\u2019ll do, about a month\u2019s wait. Afterward, just bring me money, and I\u2019ll say, \u2018Good, good, good, you found the right surname!\u2019\" Renbo shook his head and refused to pay, insisting the process should be done without bribery. Over forty years ago, Aunt E became a Thai citizen and also changed her surname. But Uncle, Aunt E\u2019s eldest sister, and her eldest brother-in-law didn\u2019t change their surnames, so Aunt E has always lived in Thailand as a foreigner. Grandpa once asked Uncle about it, and he said, \"I\u2019m Chinese, what\u2019s the point of changing nationality?\" But not being a Thai citizen has its inconveniences. Since Uncle wasn\u2019t Thai, he had to use Aunt E\u2019s name to buy land and build a house. After turning 60, he also didn\u2019t receive the government\u2019s pension. When Aunt E was still selling vegetables, life was manageable. After she turned 60, she stopped selling and began receiving government aid. Renbo would give her some extra money each month, initially 500 or 700 baht, later 1,000 baht. \"I know in my heart,\" she said. \"When you grow up, you understand what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not.\" She also said that it wasn\u2019t her parents who taught her to do this. \"Chinese and foreigners are not the same. Foreigners don\u2019t understand... but maybe not, percentage-wise it\u2019s different.\" The cause of Aunt E\u2019s death isn\u2019t very clear to Grandpa. Renbo spoke to him about it a few years ago, but Grandpa couldn\u2019t understand his Chaozhou dialect. Renbo later told me via a translation app that it was a stomach perforation. Before coming to Thailand this time, my family asked me to bring some dried shiitake mushrooms, morel mushrooms, hawthorn, and old citron. Grandpa said that people there like these, and in the past, when foreign guests returned, they always brought these items back. When we arrived at Renbo\u2019s house, Aunt E saw the mushrooms and said, \"Second Aunt loves these. She often asked me to go to Chinatown to buy them.\" When Renbo worked abroad, Aunt E would call him every month. If she wanted to eat Chinese goods or needed offerings for ancestor worship, she would have Renbo buy them. \"She loves to eat these, so I go and buy the best ones for her.\" Aunt E would speak very quickly, never hanging up the phone for less than half an hour. She\u2019d ask Renbo, \"Have you transferred the money yet? Have you transferred it yet?\" Uncle would reply, \"I\u2019ll transfer it next week. You go to Yaowarat and buy ginkgo nuts and red dates for Aunt.\" Farewell I came to Siam, to the places where Aunt E once stepped. I was able to rediscover her distant story and felt genuinely happy for her from the bottom of my heart. Aunt E is a good person\u2014ordinary, honest, and living a simple, earnest life. After the death of her eldest brother-in-law twenty years ago, her mental and physical health deteriorated, and she developed Alzheimer's disease. When she was happy, she liked to talk about the past\u2014saying, \u201cIn the past, I knew; but now, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Aunt E would reminisce, \u201cIn the old days, when someone hit my little sister, I would fight back.\u201d Renbo asked her about her younger brother. She recalled that someone had asked her to go to Tangshan to find him, but it was hard to locate him, and she didn\u2019t succeed. Aunt E also remembered that Grandpa had come to Thailand many years ago\u2014twenty years ago. Renbo asked, \u201cWould you like to go to Tangshan? Or not?\u201d She replied, \u201cNo, no, nothing good to eat there.\u201d She only responds to others when in a good mood. When she\u2019s upset, she becomes impatient, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t talk, don\u2019t talk, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\u201d She gets upset if there are too many people, or if the noise around her is too loud. If too many things are said at once, she also becomes unhappy. Her sons would try to say good things to her at home, teaching her to say, \u201cHappy New Year, wish you prosperity!\u201d When the eldest uncle said the first part, Aunt E would always finish with the second part. In 2021, Aunt E passed away during the COVID-19 pandemic at the age of 91. Grandpa passed away more than a decade ago due to a stroke. Grandma is still alive, now 85, but she also has Alzheimer\u2019s disease. She is currently unable to care for herself and is being looked after by caregivers in the hospital, bedridden. In 2003, she visited Chaozhou to see relatives and stayed at my house. After that visit, Grandpa planned to return to see her, but he never did. We flipped through the black-and-white photos Aunt E brought. For each elderly relative\u2014Mother, Aunt E, Grandpa, and others\u2014Aunt E gave me a copy to take home, saying, \u201cTake them to Tangshan and show them around.\u201d The grave of Mother\u2019s mother is located in the southern part of Bangkok, in the Nakhon Pathom province, on a small piece of land next to other people's graves. This cemetery is mostly filled with Chinese people, Renbo told me. Every year during Qingming (Tomb Sweeping Day), Aunt E and Grandpa would visit to pay respects to their father. Because of her leg problems, Aunt E would go only occasionally. Renbo began accompanying Aunt E on these visits when he was around nine years old. At first, they took a bus, transferring three or four times to reach the cemetery. Later, as more people joined, about ten in total, they hired a vehicle to go there. After the graves were cleaned, they would head south to Bangsaen Beach to relax. Since then, Renbo almost always joined the trip, except during the two years of the pandemic. When Renbo took me to the cemetery that day, everything was quiet. The only sound was the rustling of our feet through the overgrown grass. This place likely only becomes lively during Qingming. The gravestones were closely packed together\u2014some hidden behind thick grass, others with inscriptions completely faded, perhaps from years of neglect. The gravestones indicated the hometowns of the deceased, almost all from the Eight Regions of Chaozhou. People from different dialect groups were buried together. We walked through grass that reached up to our calves and knees to reach the grave of Mother\u2019s mother. The inscription listed her origin as \"Puyin, Egongkeng, Xiang,\" meaning a village in Chaozhou. The gravestone had been renovated by Grandpa more than a decade ago, with dragon and phoenix paintings on either side, and lotus flowers. In front of the grave was a stone platform, decorated with a fruit tray. There was no wild grass around this grave, and the grass on the mound was neatly trimmed. The name of Aunt E's mother was also engraved on the stone, even though she wasn't buried here. \"Grandpa, your grandson has come from Tangshan to visit you,\" Renbo said.","title":"They are in Siam"},{"location":"history/they_are_in_siam/#they-are-in-siam","text":"In the spring of 2017, at 18 years old, I traveled alone to Bangkok to \"find\" my second grand-aunt. \"She's on Song Wat Road near the Grand Palace,\" Grandpa told me before I left. Second grand-aunt didn\u2019t speak Mandarin, only Teochew, and her vocabulary still belonged to an older era. Over the phone, she asked me where I was staying\u2014\"which inn or guesthouse \"\u2014so that my uncle could pick me up. I replied that I was staying at a \"homestay.\" She didn\u2019t understand. \"Where exactly?\" she asked. I thought of saying \"Airbnb,\" but figured she wouldn\u2019t know the term and that I couldn\u2019t possibly explain the English address to her over the phone. I had no choice but to say, \"I\u2019m staying at a friend\u2019s place; I\u2019ll come to you.\" Second grand-aunt gave me an address and told me to ask around if I couldn\u2019t find it: \"Just ask for Aunt E.\" I agreed repeatedly. Near the bustling Siam Square shopping district in Bangkok, I flagged down a taxi. \"To the Grand Palace,\" I said. Truth be told, I hadn\u2019t memorized the exact address second grand-aunt had given me. She spoke in Teochew, and I wasn\u2019t sure what characters corresponded to her words. I only caught the street name \"Song Wat Road\" and a house number, but the alley name and specific details became a blur in my mind. Sitting in the cab, I looked out the window at the familiar Lingnan-style buildings: three- to four-story homes rising vertically, old metal shutter gates on the ground floor, and storefront signs with Chinese characters. It looked so much like Chaoshan (my ancestral hometown) that I nearly forgot I was in Bangkok. My original plan was to walk to second grand-aunt\u2019s place after arriving at the Grand Palace. But while checking the map in the cab, I realized her home was still far away from there. Song Wat Road, an eight-kilometer stretch, runs southeast from the Grand Palace through Chinatown, then follows the Chao Phraya River southwest. I don\u2019t remember exactly how I negotiated with the driver, but after several adjustments to the destination, I handed him the phone to speak directly with second grand-aunt. When we finally reached the spot, the driver grinned and charged me an extra 100 baht. This was Bangkok\u2019s Bang Kho Laem district, near the iconic Ferris wheel of Asiatique, the riverside night market. On the streets, luxury hotels, high-rise condos, and modest houses alternated. The driver pointed to an alley and said, \"It\u2019s here.\" At the alley entrance, I asked an older man in Teochew, \"Uncle, is Aunt E here?\" He looked a bit surprised. \"Aunt E? Oh, Aunt E!\" Then he stood up and said he\u2019d take me to her. After walking just a few steps, I saw Aunt E approaching, supported by a middle-aged man. That was our first meeting. She had a head of silver hair, wore glasses, and had a string of beads around her neck. She looked much thinner than in photos. That year, she was 83 but still full of energy, clear-minded, and warmly conversational. The alley was narrow, only about two meters wide. After walking a few steps in, we passed a small temple at a corner, with red Chinese characters on bamboo lanterns hanging on either side. Deeper into the alley, at the far end, was Aunt E\u2019s home. Aunt E is my second grand-aunt, Grandpa\u2019s second eldest sister. In 1946, Aunt E boarded a ship to Siam (Thailand) from Shantou with her father, elder sister, and younger brother. There were too many people fleeing famine, so her mother and youngest brother (my grandpa) couldn\u2019t get on the ship. From that point on, the family was split in two, separated by the heavens and the earth. Some stayed in Siam, while others remained tied to Tangshan (a traditional term for China). Why did she leave? Why Siam? What event or moment finally made her decide to go? For those granted different choices by fate at the same time, how did their lives diverge in two lands? Did those who left ever regret their decision? Did those who stayed behind ever resent the unfairness of it all? Did they think of reuniting, or of returning? And how did they eventually reconnect? These questions flooded my mind, intense and unrelenting. I decided to seek answers. I traveled to Thailand and also returned to my ancestral hometown. Some questions have faded into the dust with the passing of the older generation, but others have allowed me to glimpse how the threads of our family\u2019s fate were tangled and stretched over time.","title":"They are in Siam"},{"location":"history/they_are_in_siam/#those-who-left","text":"Aunt E and her family lived in a rural village at the border of Puning County and Jieyang County. Before moving back to the village, they had been living in a nearby small town. However, the house they were staying in was reclaimed by its owner, leaving them with no choice but to return. By that time, their ancestral home had already been passed down to the family of the third brother, leaving Aunt E and her family to sleep in a corner of the living room. Her father, known as Zai-Niang, was a farmer who sold vegetables to make a living. He was the second brother in his family, with elder and younger brothers named Zi-Niang and Zai-Fu. Interestingly, in Teochew (Chaozhou) dialect, Zi-Niang translates to \"woman.\" It is said that before the eldest son was born, the family faced many tragedies with infant mortality, particularly with male children, while female infants survived. In response, they began giving their sons feminine names, believing it might ensure their survival. However, Zai-Niang's youngest brother did not follow this tradition, as by then, the other three sons had already survived. Such gender-biased traditions were not uncommon in rural Teochew villages. In 1931, Puning County recorded 266,400 males but only 195,800 females\u2014a stark gender imbalance. When exactly Aunt E left, my grandfather didn\u2019t know. In fact, he never even met her. For many Teochew people, Siam (modern Thailand) wasn\u2019t a far-off, unreachable place. It frequently appeared in proverbs and folk songs, such as \u201cFrom Siam to the pig trough\u201d or \u201cIf you\u2019ve got nothing, go to Siam.\u201d Another common song went: \"The Siam ship, on distant waters, Who knows if we\u2019ll live or die today. If you don\u2019t make a living abroad, You\u2019ll die a ghost in despair.\u201d Siam wasn\u2019t just a foreign land\u2014it was also a place where kinship and bloodlines offered a lifeline. For centuries, from the red-hulled junks to steamships, all kinds of people\u2014merchants, sailors, craftsmen, laborers, pirates, fugitives, and refugees\u2014sailed south to the vast expanse of Nanyang (Southeast Asia). By 1955, about 1.297 million Teochew people lived in Thailand, comprising 56% of the country\u2019s total Chinese population. The destinies of Teochew and Siam have long been intertwined. In 1767, a man of Teochew heritage, King Taksin, established the Thonburi Kingdom in Siam. Following his rise, Teochew merchants flourished in the region, gaining economic privileges, such as controlling the import of Siamese rice. Teochew plantation owners in Siam also recruited large numbers of workers from their hometown, while Teochew craftsmen were employed by the monarchy to help construct the capitals of Thonburi and Bangkok. In later decades, natural disasters and poverty continued to drive people away from Teochew. But migration was also spurred by violence and social disorder. Teochew was considered a particularly volatile frontier, beyond the full control of China\u2019s central government. The region was rife with clan feuds, resource disputes, opium smuggling, and gang activity. In 1869, the Qing government launched a pacification campaign along Teochew\u2019s coast, arresting and executing thousands of so-called \u201ctroublemakers,\u201d burning villages, and forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes. This destruction normalized large-scale male migration, particularly to Siam. War and political instability further embedded violence into the lives of ordinary people. Between 1918 and 1931, approximately 1.577 million people left Shantou port for Southeast Asia, with 868,000 going to Siam. Migration surged during tumultuous years\u2014such as 1927, when 222,000 people left Shantou, and 1928, when another 212,000 followed. These spikes coincided with the Nationalists defeating warlords and suppressing communists in the Hailufeng region. By comparison, only 84,000 people left Shantou in 1926. The exact moment when Aunt E\u2019s family made their decision to leave remains unclear. Perhaps it was a long, bleak day. County records only hint at the cascading disasters they faced before departure: prolonged warfare, droughts, floods, and famines. In late 1942 through early 1943, Guangdong suffered from severe winter and spring droughts. The early rice harvest failed. Starving villagers raided food stores, and horrifyingly, there were even reports of cannibalism. In Puning County alone, about 100,000 people either starved, fell ill, or fled. Over 70% of farmland was affected, spanning 360,000 acres. In neighboring Jieyang County, 68,400 people starved to death, 22,300 young girls and infants were sold, and 24,200 people fled to nearby provinces. Cholera outbreaks followed, killing 400 people in the nearby town where my grandfather\u2019s family lived. Meanwhile, Japanese occupation exacerbated the famine by restricting fishing and halting grain imports. During this famine, my grandfather, less than a year old, was taken by his great-grandmother to a wealthy family. Enchanted by his fluffy hair and cuteness, they considered adopting him. In the end, however, she couldn\u2019t bear to part with him and brought him back. Folk songs from this period preserve the collective memory of hunger: \"Millet weed, millet weed, Eat it, vomit it back up\u2026 No grain for the farmers, Hunger forces them to eat millet weed.\" In 1946, Aunt E\u2019s family decided to leave. Her father, Zai-Niang, pawned their four acres of farmland to pay for the journey. On the way to Shantou, he was beaten and robbed of some of the money after taking a wrong turn near customs. Furthermore, with so many refugees, tickets for the ship to Siam were allocated by lottery. The family decided that the father would take his 16-year-old and 12-year-old daughters and his 8-year-old son to Siam first. The mother and youngest son (my grandfather) would follow later. But they never reunited. After traveling to Shantou with funds sent by relatives in Siam, they were told the port was now restricting entry to \u201cnewcomers.\u201d My grandfather\u2019s mother\u2019s illness\u2014a contagious eye condition\u2014might also have prevented them from boarding. These barriers reflected Siam\u2019s tightening immigration policies. Starting in the 1920s, Siam introduced measures to assimilate its Chinese population while imposing restrictions on new arrivals. Entry taxes, literacy requirements, and bans on those with diseases like trachoma made it increasingly difficult for poor laborers and women to immigrate. These restrictions intensified after World War II as the Thai government sought to control the surge of refugees. In the end, Siam became a far-off place my grandfather and his mother could never reach\u2014a distant land forever just out of reach.","title":"Those Who Left"},{"location":"history/they_are_in_siam/#ah-ai","text":"Grandma's name was Ah Ai. I am deeply curious about her. What kind of person was this grandmother who raised her son alone? How did she live her life in Chaozhou, relying only on her son? I also wonder what Ah Ai looked like. Unfortunately, no photos of her remain. According to my grandfather, she had an oval face, thin eyebrows, a slender build, and wore her hair in a round bun at the back of her head. She often dressed in loose traditional garments. Unable to board the ship, Ah Ai and her young son returned to their hometown. As a widow with a child, they were bullied by villagers and had to move around, eventually staying at her sister\u2019s house. Her sister\u2019s home was near the riverbank of the Rongjiang River, where many children enjoyed swimming. However, Ah Ai was strict with her son, only allowing him to bathe by the river but forbidding him to go into deeper waters. When it was time to come back, she would call him home. As a result, while the neighboring children all learned to swim, her son never did. Her husband sent money monthly from overseas to support their living expenses. On many nights, under the dim candlelight, Ah Ai would process gold foil paper for extra income. Her son, still young, would sit nearby and keep her company. Sometimes, when his eyes became heavy with sleep, she would tap his head gently to keep him awake. During holidays, she would take him to the temple to worship or go watch performances in front of the local theater. Ah Ai was hesitant to go overseas even when her daughter, born in Thailand, offered to send her travel funds. This does not seem to align with the image of Ah Ai my grandfather described. He said Ah Ai was \"strong-minded.\" Her mental arithmetic amazed others. In the past, scales were measured in units of 16 taels per jin (a Chinese pound), and converting taels to jin was not straightforward. Ah Ai could calculate with ease, ensuring no one shortchanged her. Neighbors even asked her to help calculate prices when buying goods from street vendors. After the liberation of China, it became almost impossible for Ah Ai and her son to emigrate. Her husband sent back enough money for them to buy a house, so they no longer had to live with her sister. Life remained frugal. In the mornings, she would cut a single green olive in half, dip it in soy sauce, and share it with her son along with some porridge. A childhood friend of hers, who lived nearby, often came over to chat. The four acres of land that she had pawned off years ago to afford travel expenses were eventually redeemed. Ah Ai began to grow vegetables, often heading to the fields at dawn to harvest string beans. There were countless women like Ah Ai in the Minnan and Guangdong regions\u2014women who stayed behind in their hometowns while their husbands went overseas to seek livelihoods. Before the early 20th century, very few women migrated to Southeast Asia. Their husbands went alone, leaving them behind to care for their families. Some women who did manage to go overseas were drawn into human trafficking or the sex industry. From 1882 to 1892, only 2-3% of Chinese immigrants to Siam were women. This rose to under 10% before World War I, and by 1945-1949, women accounted for 31.45% of Chinese immigrants. It was not uncommon for husbands who left their hometowns to remarry abroad. A 1980s study in three counties in Fujian found that of 165 Southeast Asian immigrants, 19 workers had remarried locally after initially marrying back home\u2014a figure believed to be conservative due to the reluctance of families to disclose the truth. Meanwhile, the wives left behind lived as if they were widows. Some were tightly controlled by their families, limiting their participation in social life. The gender inequality was stark\u2014women who had extramarital affairs were seen as family disgraces, and their husbands even published notices in newspapers accusing them of being unfaithful before divorcing them. The Marriage Law introduced by New China in 1950 encouraged some of these women to seek divorce. A March 1954 report from the Guangdong People\u2019s Court\u2019s Eastern Branch recorded 74 cases of overseas Chinese marriage disputes in Puning County that year. Nearly a third of the divorces were due to the husbands remarrying abroad, another third were because of long separations, and some cases involved pregnancies from extramarital relationships or brides who had only seen their husbands in photos but never met them in person despite years of marriage. In such cases, divorces were granted if the husband had been missing for years or had remarried, and attempts at reconciliation failed. If the husband maintained correspondence and financial support, the decision depended on specific circumstances, such as the couple\u2019s feelings, the length of separation, and the level of financial support. However, the Marriage Law sparked discontent among overseas Chinese. Since remittances from overseas were a crucial source of foreign currency for China, in April 1954, the government issued a directive: If the overseas husband had not remarried, maintained correspondence, and sent remittances, the wife\u2019s request for divorce should be discouraged. Officials were instructed to mediate and persuade the wife to abandon the idea of divorce. Ah Ai\u2019s circumstances were different from others. She spent more than 20 years with her husband and decided to take her child to Siam to rebuild their life together. Although they faced obstacles, she continued to strive for a reunion. During their ten years apart, her husband sent monthly remittances, and they kept in touch through letters. Had life continued in this steady, uneventful way, it might not have been so bad. But in 1956, ten years after her husband and child had left, Ah Ai lost her eyesight. It was said to be glaucoma, but no doctor she consulted could cure it. Her young son, who was in sixth grade at the time, dropped out of school to care for her and took over her gardening work. He sold sweet potatoes to families who ground them into starch and carried vegetables to sell in the streets. It was during this time that he learned how to cook. After a year, he returned to school and made up for a missed semester. That same year, he failed his entrance exams for junior high school and decided to study on his own at home for another year. His fifteenth year slipped away in a routine of caring for his mother, growing and selling vegetables, and self-studying. In 1958, he successfully passed the entrance exam for Jieyang County No. 2 Middle School. He was a diligent student. During meals, he would draw unsolved geometry problems on the wall and study them while eating. Sometimes, inspiration struck, and his eyes lit up. Suddenly, he would put down his bowl. \"Brother, are you full?\" Ah Ai would ask in surprise. \"Not yet, I just thought of a solution!\" One day that year, while digging sweet potatoes in the field as usual, the village cadres came by and said, \u201cBrother, once these sweet potatoes are dug up, you won\u2019t be planting here anymore.\u201d He asked why. \u201cThe land will be collectivized,\u201d they replied. Embarrassed, he left and never returned to farming. Satirical folk songs about the false promises and exaggerations of the collectivization period were common at the time: \u201cThe house beams are large, one acre yields ten thousand; The communal kitchens scatter, the first meal swears oaths.\u201d \u201cThis year\u2019s bumper harvest, food rations are snatched; Surpassing the UK and the US, millet is made into water.\u201d The middle school also set up a communal kitchen where students had to eat, but he had no memories of the communal meals\u2014he had to return home to care for his blind mother. He was already used to being alone. After school, he went straight home, never participating in extracurricular activities with classmates. He didn\u2019t play basketball or table tennis. He rarely smiled, his face always stern. Because he looked \"intimidating,\" no one dared to bully him, and he had no conflicts with others. However, when it came time to join the Communist Youth League, the class League members rejected him, saying, \"You don\u2019t follow the collective path; you refuse to eat at school.\" \u201cI really had no choice,\u201d my grandfather said with a chuckle as he recalled this. \u201cThey counted it as a shortcoming and didn\u2019t let me join.\u201d After 1958, due to the Great Leap Forward and collectivization, overseas Chinese households were mobilized to turn over their assets. Remittances from overseas dropped significantly. Faced with domestic hardships and material shortages, overseas Chinese began sending rice, oil, and other goods instead of money. To secure foreign exchange, the Chinese government declared that after joining people\u2019s communes, personal living supplies, remittances, and savings of overseas Chinese families would remain privately owned. Later, policies allowing the purchase of goods with remittance vouchers were implemented, and special supply stores for overseas Chinese were established. These stores were abolished in 1966 and only reinstated in 1976. Bad news from afar arrived during this time. In August 1959, Ah Ai\u2019s husband passed away in Bangkok. Her son, seeing the red remittance letter with the obituary written in pencil, decided to keep the news from her. Until the day she died, Ah Ai never knew about her husband\u2019s death. Ah Ai's health deteriorated in the spring of 1961. During the second semester of his third year in junior high, during every recess, her son would rush home to brew herbal medicine and prepare lunch. He often had to fetch doctors to treat her and prescribe medicine. After lunch, he would return to school for the afternoon classes. In early June of that year, on a quiet evening, Ah Ai passed away without a sound. Her son finished preparing dinner and went to call her to eat, but she didn\u2019t respond. Panicking, he ran out of the house and sprinted through the village to find his third uncle and his wife. Together, they hurried to the town. He then wove through countless winding alleys to reach the riverside and informed his maternal aunt. There was no formal funeral. Everything was done quietly, with no one daring to make a fuss. It was the era of the Four Olds campaign. Even the wealthy refrained from holding funerals, let alone those who were poor. The neighborhood committee director helped apply for a free coffin, and Ah Ai was buried in a mound of earth in her husband\u2019s village. From sixth grade to his final year of junior high, her son had cared for his blind mother for nearly five years. When asked about her cause of death, he said, \"It was probably malnutrition, edema. At that time, life in the country was hard economically.\" After Ah Ai's death, her son began attending evening classes at school. Returning home after class, he would sleep for a few hours, wake up around 2 a.m., light a kerosene lamp, and study until dawn before heading back to school. This routine repeated every day. He performed well in his graduation exams, ranking second in the year for physics. The top scorer was a girl from the same village who went on to high school and later married into another area. Her son, however, was two years older than his peers. He was over the age limit to apply for a regular high school and wasn\u2019t allowed to take the exams. Instead, he enrolled in Jieyang Normal School. After his father\u2019s death, the remittance letters began being signed by his elder brother, and later by E-jie (his older sister). However, he later discovered that his elder brother had never sent money. Initially, it was their eldest sister who sent the funds\u2014she had borrowed money from their father and, after his death, decided not to repay it directly to her younger brother. Instead, she sent it under their elder brother\u2019s name to support his education. E-jie eventually took over and sent even more. Once the eldest sister\u2019s debt was \"repaid,\" E-jie began sending 30 Hong Kong dollars a month, which he exchanged for 12.81 RMB. She often encouraged him to study diligently. In her letters, she wrote, \u201cStudy hard. I won\u2019t get married yet. Once I\u2019m married, I might not be able to support you.\u201d E-jie once sent him a black-and-white photo of herself to his school. She looked elegant and fashionable, with short curly hair, fine arched eyebrows, crescent-shaped eyes, and adorned with ornate earrings, a necklace, and a lace-trimmed dress. Like Ah Ai, she had single eyelids and small eyes. \"So refined,\" her son said years later, still admiring her in the photo. He also sent E-jie a photo of himself, taken in his early twenties. He had thick eyebrows and big eyes, wearing a sweater and jacket. The brown wool was purchased from the Overseas Chinese Store. \u201cThat was when I looked dashing,\u201d he said with a smile. In 1964, he graduated and was assigned to teach at a rural elementary school. \u201cAt that time, people were so enthusiastic. The country needed us, and that was our aspiration\u2014to follow assignments without question,\u201d he said, laughing. With his job secured, he immediately wrote to his sister, telling her she no longer needed to send money. The Cultural Revolution soon began. Having overseas connections became a liability, so he burned many remittance letters. Communication between them dwindled, eventually stopping almost entirely. \"There was hardly any contact after that,\" he said.","title":"Ah Ai"},{"location":"history/they_are_in_siam/#aunt-e","text":"In the place where I was born, people were accustomed to stories of migrating to Southeast Asia. Relatives of ours in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand were casually mentioned in idle chatter at the tea table. Those who returned home to visit family were called fan ke (returning guests), and they would bring gifts from faraway places to distribute among the waiting mouths. The overseas Chinese hospital in the town, as well as the elementary school where my grandfather later taught, were both donated by fan ke who had been away from home for many years. For a long time, I knew very little about my relatives in Thailand. What kind of people were they? What kind of work did they do there? What neighborhood did they live in in Bangkok, and who lived there? Had they ever had a better life? Filled with curiosity and questions, I went to Thailand. In 2017, I remember arriving at E-jie's house step by step, and the beautiful distant place I had imagined began to slowly crumble. Under the eaves of E-jie's house, there were many ants, crawling around the shoes, some even climbing onto them. Inside, the lighting was dim, the decoration was simple, and the furnishings were old. Leftover food was covered with a plastic food cover on the table. In her old age, due to diabetes, her eyesight had deteriorated somewhat, and my grandfather gave me some money to pass on to her for medical treatment. Whenever Thailand was mentioned, my grandparents would always bring up E-jie, saying how much money she sent to support my grandfather\u2019s living expenses. E-jie treated my grandfather very well, and we all knew that. Because of this, I had a special feeling for her. Although I had never met her, I naturally wanted to get close and learn more about this woman who shared my bloodline. From my one-sided perspective, E-jie\u2019s old age seemed less than ideal. I heard comments from others expressing sympathy and regret for her fate, feeling that she had struggled and wasn't truly happy. Her life was summed up in a few simple words of lament. E-jie used to sell vegetables in Da Le and worked until she was 60. She never had children but adopted a boy from another country, an infant who had been abandoned at birth. A few years later, she divorced. One day, I ran into her adopted son. We couldn\u2019t communicate due to the language barrier, and after a brief, somewhat awkward exchange, he left. At that time, I felt sadness for E-jie\u2019s past and present. A woman who had already left but was still giving, and her difficult life\u2014selling vegetables in the market, raising her younger brother from afar. Did she sacrifice her own intimate relationships and happiness by waiting for him to graduate before marrying? I had thought this way until I visited Thailand again this year. This summer, I went back to Thailand and stayed at Ren Bo\u2019s house. Ren Bo is the second son of my eldest aunt. The first time I visited Bangkok, I had also met him at E-jie\u2019s house. Ren Bo was born in 1962. From the age of seven, he helped E-jie sell vegetables after school. He was probably the youngest relative who spent the most time with E-jie and was the closest to her. He was always by her side as a child, running errands for her. As he grew up, the elders praised him for being thoughtful and kind to others. From Ren Bo\u2019s stories, I glimpsed a small corner of E-jie\u2019s life and unexpectedly discovered another side of her\u2014stories I had never heard before. \u201cShe is a kind, sports-loving person who likes to buy things for others,\u201d Ren Bo\u2019s translation app told me when I asked about E-jie. Ren Bo grew up speaking Chaozhou dialect with the elders and speaking Thai with his brothers and friends. He hasn\u2019t spoken much of either language lately, and his Chaozhou dialect has become quite rusty and less fluent. Sometimes, when he doesn\u2019t know how to express something, he opens Google Translate. He presses the \u201cmicrophone\u201d button, hesitates for a few seconds, carefully thinks about what he wants to say, afraid he won't express it clearly. But after waiting too long in silence, the microphone stops recording before he can speak. E-jie lived close to my eldest aunt, just a few minutes away. Every day, she would go to the market nearby to sell vegetables, having her own stall. Around 9 a.m., she would take someone\u2019s car to buy the goods. Two hours later, she would call out, \u201cThe vegetables are here!\u201d and Ren Bo and his uncle would come out to unload the vegetables from the car, then use a small cart to push them to the market. After that, Ren Bo would help E-jie arrange and prepare the vegetables at the stall. At 1 p.m., E-jie would open the stall on her own. She smiled a lot, and when business was good, there were many customers. Between two and three in the afternoon was the busiest time. She probably took after her mother\u2019s \u201cstrong spirit,\u201d talking a lot, loving to chat, and speaking Thai fluently. Ren Bo said she was \u201ctalkative\u201d and \u201cstrong in speech.\u201d His eldest aunt also sold vegetables, but she didn\u2019t talk much\u2014quiet, with a neutral expression, and her business wasn\u2019t as good. In my grandmother\u2019s memory, E-jie was very strong-willed. She once told my grandfather that the second sister was very \u201cwild,\u201d stubborn, while the eldest sister was honest. When they were young, the eldest and second sisters would go gather tree leaves to bring home for fuel. One day, they encountered two boys about their age in the village. A fight broke out, and they ended up using rakes to hit each other, scattering in all directions. The eldest sister had been sick as a child and now walked with a limp, too scared to move as the fight ensued. But the second sister beat the two boys so badly that they cried out loud. Even though her own hands were bruised, she didn\u2019t cry. Afterward, she sat quietly, her face dark and silent, not saying anything. The boys' mother came to their house, accusing the second sister of causing a bump on her son's head. My grandmother didn\u2019t back down either. She took the second sister out and said, \u201cThis is a matter between the children, don\u2019t come looking for trouble. Look at mine\u2014she didn\u2019t cry even though her hands were bruised.\u201d \"(In Siam), we used to sell vegetables, and the business was good. All the vendors were Chinese,\" Ren Bo said. He used traditional terms to refer to different groups: the Chinese were called \"Tang people,\" the Thai were \"foreigners,\" the Malays were \"Hakka,\" and Westerners were \"red-haired.\" By five or six in the evening, when the crowd had thinned out and E-jie was tired, she would return to her elder sister\u2019s house to rest. \"Ren, come help Auntie sell vegetables.\" Ren Bo got off school around three in the afternoon and would watch the stall until seven. After closing, he would sweep away the vegetable leaves, and E-jie would pack up the unsold vegetables into baskets, adding frost water. I misunderstood and thought she said \"sour water\"\u2014what was that? I didn\u2019t understand. \"Ice, little pieces, the vegetables stay cool. In the past, there was no freezer,\" Ren Bo explained. I realized it was referring to ice water and refrigerators. Frost water, freezer\u2014terms I had never used before. Ren Bo recalled that E-jie used to make seven or eight Thai baht a day from selling vegetables. After closing the stall, she would give him one or two baht as pocket money, which he would use to buy food. Two baht could buy a bowl of pig\u2019s feet rice, two bowls of rice noodle soup, or four skewers of grilled pork. \"Money was worth a lot back then, now the rice noodles cost forty or fifty,\" Ren Bo remarked. Ren Bo smiled and said that E-jie was relatively well-off and often helped his elder sister and younger brother. He also knew that E-jie sent money to my grandfather. \"Business was good, so she sent money to Tangshan,\" he added. But he also said, \"E-jie wasn\u2019t very rich, just somewhat well-off.\" Wealth, according to Ren Bo, was measured by food: \"Whatever you want to eat, she can get it.\" \"I\u2019d go to her place to get food,\" Ren Bo laughed. He had six siblings, and he was the second oldest. \"At our house, there were two dishes for eight people; at her house, three dishes for three or four people.\" Wherever they went, whatever they wanted to eat, Ren Bo would take E-jie along. How should I describe my feelings when I first learned this news? Surprise, relief, and a deep sense of comfort? E-jie\u2019s life was not as difficult as I had imagined. The money sent back to Tangshan wasn\u2019t squeezed out of her, either. Thank goodness. At that moment, I was almost at a loss for words, only feeling a mix of shock and joy. No one knew exactly when E-jie got married. Ren Bo recalled that when he was five, she was already married, but he couldn\u2019t remember anything earlier. From the information he could piece together, she probably got married between the ages of 30 and 33, which would have been between 1964, the year my grandfather graduated from normal school, and 1967, when Ren Bo was five and able to remember things. E-jie\u2019s husband had a son with his ex-wife, who occasionally came to E-jie\u2019s house for meals, and Ren Bo had met him. A few years after they married, E-jie left that man. Ren Bo said the man was selfish and had other women. E-jie decisively divorced him. Afterward, she had other boyfriends. Ren Bo recalled that when he was five, he used to get into trouble with people, even messing around at E-jie\u2019s vegetable stall. \"She was selling vegetables, hadn\u2019t even started, and I went over to ask for money, saying, \u2018Aunt, I want to buy something to eat.\u2019 She scolded me, saying, \u2018I haven\u2019t even sold anything yet, and you want money.\u2019\" A few years later, when Ren Bo matured, he began helping E-jie sell vegetables. E-jie was always willing to satisfy his needs. Every year during the holidays, Ren Bo would ask E-jie for new clothes, and she would buy them for him to wear. Near the vegetable stall, someone sold crispy coconut milk, which Ren Bo liked, so E-jie would tell him to buy an egg and have the vendor add it to the milk, making it taste even better. Sometimes, after selling the vegetables, Ren Bo would want to watch a movie, and E-jie would take him on a three- or four-stop bus ride to the cinema. She loved watching Chinese and Thai films. \"David Chiang (Jiang David), do you know him? From Hong Kong,\" Ren Bo asked me. I shook my head. \"Didn\u2019t you take your uncle or third uncle?\" I asked. Ren Bo laughed. \"No, they didn\u2019t like to watch those kinds of films. My uncle wasn\u2019t interested; he wouldn\u2019t go.\" After finishing middle school, Ren Bo wanted to attend a public business college. Public colleges were cheaper, while private ones were much more expensive. E-jie said that if he didn\u2019t pass the entrance exam, she would pay for him to go to a private one. She knew that his eldest aunt\u2019s family couldn\u2019t afford that much. Fortunately, Ren Bo passed the exam and was able to attend a public college, so E-jie didn\u2019t have to provide extra money. In the summer of 2017, five months after I visited E-jie, my family went to Thailand, including my 75-year-old grandfather. It was his second trip to Thailand; his first had been in 1999. When E-jie saw the whole family arrive, she was so happy that she couldn\u2019t stop smiling. My grandfather said that it was clear her joy was genuine. At that time, E-jie was still talkative. My grandfather gave her money for medical expenses again, and not long after returning to China, E-jie was hospitalized. In December of that year, E-jie passed away in Bangkok.","title":"Aunt E"},{"location":"history/they_are_in_siam/#arrival-in-siam","text":"Ren Bo stared at a black-and-white photo for a long time. Several women, dressed in white short-sleeve tops and black pants, stood in front of a newly erected tombstone, still without an inscription. It was the grave of Zai Niang (Grandmother). \"They were all neighbors,\" Ren Bo suddenly remembered, pointing to each person and saying: \"This one is my friend's grandmother; this one, she sells duck rice noodles, our neighbor; this one, I used to call her 'Drama Aunt,' but later she stopped acting and started selling chicken, duck, and pork; this one, an old lady, a kind person, when we were poor and had little to eat, she sold salted food in Daxi and brought some to us.\" They were all neighbors of Zai Niang. \"The locals all say that Grandpa (Zai Niang) was an honest person,\" Ren Bo had told me when I first arrived. He added, his friend's father had also said that Zai Niang had a kind heart and was a good person. The photo was brought by Gu Jing, the daughter of Ren Bo\u2019s father. In Chaoshan, I called her \"A Jing Gu,\" but after coming to Thailand, I followed the local custom of placing the name after the title, so I referred to her as \"Gu Jing.\" Gu Jing found a large red iron box at home, filled with many old black-and-white photographs. Before coming, she had told me via WeChat that she wanted to give me some of her husband's old photos. \"Bring him to his homeland,\" she had said in Chaozhou dialect. Gu Jing was beautiful; I had seen her photo when I was a child. In the picture, she held a bouquet of flowers, wearing a black graduation gown, standing between her parents, smiling brightly. It was clear her hairstyle had been carefully done, with two small curls of hair hanging down on each side. There was another photo where she wore a light-colored suit and had neatly cut short hair. In these photos, she was always surrounded by flowers, trees, and golden buildings, which took me, a child of less than ten, into a glamorous world I had never known. I secretly admired the refined, mature adults and envied a world that wasn\u2019t mine. \"If you have any questions, just ask us,\" Gu Ying said. She was Gu Jing's older sister, six years older than her. I had also seen Gu Ying in photos before; one was from a wedding where she married a Thai-born Chaozhou man. Gu Ying spoke some Chaozhou dialect, and in the past, when their family spoke it, Gu Ying followed along, but now she had forgotten much of it. Whenever I asked a question, Gu Ying and Ren Bo would rack their brains to answer me in Chaozhou dialect. Then they would discuss the true answer in Thai, a language I couldn\u2019t understand. After figuring it out, they would tell me. If no one knew how to express something, they would leave it to Gu Jing, who spoke Chaozhou and some \"red-haired\" (foreign) language, or they would turn to Google Translate. Ren Bo's uncles and aunts were born after Zai Niang had passed, so what they knew and spoke was mostly what they had heard from the older generation. However, now most of the elders had also passed. Many past events, like the \"famine in Tangshan,\" \"no food,\" and \"hardship,\" were vaguely summarized. No one knew the finer details of how the family had first found a place to live or made a living. Only a few scattered memories allowed me to roughly understand what had happened a long time ago. In 1946, after spending almost a month on the ship, Zai Niang and her three children finally arrived in Bangkok. That was probably the first time they saw the sea. They had lived in the inland area of Chaoshan, where there were only hills, rivers, and farmland. But the excitement of seeing the sea might have quickly been overshadowed by seasickness and hunger. They drank water until their stomachs swelled, and then they were so hungry that they fell into a deep sleep, losing track of day and night. Once they reached Bangkok, others advised that they should smoke a bit to relieve the swelling. Gu Ying also heard that some people had died of hunger on the ship and were thrown into the sea. When they first arrived in Bangkok, they had no home. Zai Niang\u2019s family lived with relatives. Gu Jing added that it was a shelter. She gestured with her hands and then pointed outside the glass door at a small overhanging area that provided shelter from the rain. \"It\u2019s not inside their (relatives\u2019) house, it\u2019s the place outside,\" Gu Ying explained. Zai Niang found a new livelihood by carrying goods to sell duck eggs. Everyone called her \"Egg Seller Uncle.\" Later, the family moved out of the relative's house and into a wooden house by the river. In order to send money back to Tangshan, Zai Niang lived frugally and often ate porridge with melon strips. \"In Siam in the past, whatever you wanted to do, there was always a way. But in Tangshan, there was no way,\" Ren Bo said. Grandpa was only eight years old when he first arrived in Siam. It\u2019s unclear when exactly, but at some point, he started selling ice cakes on the street. He never went to school and was mocked by others as a hooligan. At fourteen or fifteen, he worked as an employee at a printing factory, and by the age of nineteen, he started his own printing business. Because he couldn\u2019t read, he had to hire someone to choose the characters for printing and arrange the work. Grandpa learned Thai gradually from his friends, neighbors, and relatives, and by old age, when he spoke, he sounded like a \"Thai person.\" When Grandpa visited Thailand to see his relatives, he was still in the printing business. I read about the prosperous Bangkok of that time in the novel Southern Wind Blows Dreams by the Chinese-Thai author Mudan. Cars, cinemas, telephones, and televisions\u2014confronted with the splendor of the 1950s in a foreign land, would he have been dazzled? Perhaps, like the male protagonist in the book, he believed that hard work and endurance could change his fate. The protagonist said: \"Even now, they (Thai people) don\u2019t like doing business. They\u2019re content with whatever work, as long as they have enough to eat. They don\u2019t strive to accumulate more money like we Chinese do, so most of the people doing business are Chinese.\" \"Chinese people came here and worked hard,\" Ren Bo said, echoing the sentiments of the protagonist in the book. He thought the Thais were lazy. \"Siamese people are not like Tangshan people, they\u2019re lazy.\" Ren Bo shared his opinion, believing that the Thais of the past were not industrious and liked to rest. \"But now, Grandpa doesn\u2019t know,\" he added with a silly smile, continuing, \"Chinese people, foreigners, not necessarily.\" He said, now many Chinese are wealthy and come to Thailand to do business... to do what? Ren Bo couldn\u2019t find the right words in Chaozhou dialect. His translation app told me: some of them engage in illegal work. He was referring to telecom fraud. \"Write a letter, send two baht, tell the child not to gamble, to work the farm, raise pigs, and wait until I earn enough to return to Tangshan and reunite with the family.\" Did Zai Niang ever miss her hometown? Was she curious about the changes in her homeland? Was she satisfied with her new life abroad? Grandpa said that around 1953, Zai Niang had planned to bring her three children back to Chaoshan, but the trip never happened, as they heard that China and Thailand had severed diplomatic ties. Life in Thailand wasn\u2019t stable when they first arrived. After the return of the Luang Phibun government in 1948, they continued to pressure the Chinese, including raising the foreigner residency fee from 20 baht to 400 baht. In 1952, during discussions about increasing the fee, many Chinese protested. On June 13 of that year, over 10,000 poor Chinese gathered to demonstrate. Additionally, the government sought to eliminate the influence of communism in Thailand, launching a three-month campaign in November 1952 to arrest leftist figures. The Chinese community was also divided over which Chinese political party to support, making the local social climate unstable. On a day in August 1959, Zai Niang had a stomachache and went to the hospital. After a day or two, she passed away. Auntie said it was probably cancer, as the symptoms were similar, but at the time, it wasn\u2019t diagnosed. However, Grandpa had heard different versions. He said that Zai Niang was selling duck eggs outside someone\u2019s house when the property was demolished by the government, leaving her with nowhere to go. She became so upset that she fell ill and never recovered. He couldn\u2019t remember where he heard it from, but perhaps it was mentioned by a distant relative in the 1980s when they returned to Thailand. \"This is really it, so many years later, so far away, it\u2019s been 65 years. Those people have all passed away, and there\u2019s no one to confirm it,\" Grandpa said when I shared another version of the story with him. \"When you went to Thailand, didn\u2019t you ask about Zai Niang?\" Grandpa didn\u2019t like to dig too deeply into the past. Whenever I asked him such questions, he would just laugh and say, \"I\u2019m not a reporter.\" Auntie and the others were also curious about the past in Tangshan. Gu Ying asked me, \"Is your hometown Jieyang? Do you have a photo of your grandmother (A Ai)? How old was she when she passed? After she passed, did Grandpa live alone?\" I said yes. She widened her eyes, her mouth slightly open, probably surprised since she hadn\u2019t heard much about Grandpa living alone in the past.","title":"Arrival in Siam"},{"location":"history/they_are_in_siam/#fractured-memories","text":"Grandpa just celebrated his eighty-third birthday, and signs of aging are accelerating. In the summer, the days are long. By 5:30 PM, the sky is beginning to brighten. Grandpa hops onto his bicycle, rides to the Rongjiang River, leisurely circles around the nearby village, and then returns to town. It\u2019s about a ten-kilometer route, and he arrives home around seven. His arms have become weaker, and while cycling, his flesh sags down, as if it were stuck, swaying with each pedal. One evening after dinner, he went out for a walk wearing a sleeveless shirt, and someone familiar remarked that he had become thinner. Grandpa knew it himself. The next time he went out, he would wear a short-sleeved shirt over his white vest. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you? Mind your own business,\u201d I told Grandpa, suggesting he respond like that. He laughed heartily, put on the shirt, and went out again. I know that in this small town full of social norms, it\u2019s impossible to respond like that face-to-face. I can imagine Grandpa scratching his white hair, pretending not to care, smiling awkwardly, and then walking away. Grandpa has shrunk, it\u2019s true. He used to be about 1.64 meters tall, but now he\u2019s only 1.58. His sensitivity to the sound of rain has also decreased. Recently, it\u2019s been raining a lot in the afternoons. The sound of rain against the window outside the dining table goes unnoticed by him. After a few minutes, when the sound of raindrops hitting the windowsill is clear, he always exclaims with certainty as if he\u2019s the first to notice something new: \u201cIt\u2019s raining!\u201d Before I moved away from Chaoshan at the age of twelve, we lived together with Grandpa and Grandma. In our home, Grandpa handled the chores like buying groceries, cooking, and hanging laundry. He was also the one who helped me with math problems, listened to me recite my lessons, and signed my test papers\u2014because he was easy to talk to. Occasionally, if I couldn\u2019t memorize something, he would agree to sign the paper first, then remind me to memorize it properly in private, and all I had to do was pray that I wouldn\u2019t be called on by the teacher the next day. Grandpa had a good temper and a gentle personality, but he rarely smiled in public. He always looked serious, and sometimes stubborn. After becoming a teacher, even his students were surprised by him. Grandpa said he commanded respect without saying a word: he never got angry or yelled, and his students would quietly listen in class. Some colleagues punished students for talking by making them squat next to the podium, while others slammed their desks in anger. \u201cThrowing desks and chairs is wrong,\u201d Grandpa would say slowly. When he was training as a teacher, and a student spoke out of turn in class, he would tap the desk with his fingers. Afterward, his mentor criticized him, saying it was \"a form of corporal punishment\" and \"violated teaching regulations.\" I think Grandpa definitely carries some of Grandma A Ai\u2019s traits. Or rather, the experience of depending on his mother shaped his personality. So, what about the family members who have passed? After all these years, what have they left behind for Grandpa? How does he face and process those past memories of growing up without a father or siblings? Do they still exist in Grandpa\u2019s memory? Can he remember them? How much does he recall? Time, with its sharp claws, devours Grandpa\u2019s memories. He says he no longer remembers the children\u2019s stories. But through repeated prodding and persistent efforts, the floodgates to his childhood memories were suddenly cracked open a little. Grandpa remembers that during the Lunar New Year, he sat on his father\u2019s shoulders, and the family walked to the fields by the river outside the village to watch a dragon dance. This was probably the last New Year they spent together before they parted ways. Later, in the 1980s and 1990s, houses were built on that land. Grandpa also bought land and built a house there, with the door facing the river. Nowadays, the dragon dance still takes place in that village during the Lunar New Year, but the newly built high-rise buildings block the view of the sky, and standing by the river, one can no longer see the dragon dance. In the summer, Grandma carried him outside the village to catch golden beetles on the leaves of the mallow plants. There was also a night when he was hungry, and the house had no food. Grandma carried him to the garden to pick sweet potatoes and brought them back to cook soup. The sky was dark, and he sat at the edge of the garden, watching his father digging. One time, his older sister squatted in the corner to cook, and he went over to tug on her braid. Another time, he tried to pick leaves from a potted plant, and his older brother tapped him on the head with his finger. These remaining memories are mostly fragments\u2014isolated moments, tiny, broken pieces of light that can no longer be pieced together. These memories spilled out when he saw a photo of his older sister. He said he didn\u2019t recognize the teenage version of her, and he had no recollection of her face. If he bumped into her on the street, he wouldn\u2019t know it was his sister. Grandpa remembers a few small things about his father, older sister, and older brother, but he has forgotten about his beloved second sister\u2019s childhood. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more.\u201d Grandpa couldn\u2019t remember anything else. If it weren\u2019t for seeing his father\u2019s portrait years later during a trip to Thailand, even his father\u2019s face would have become blurry in his mind. **Grandpa always speaks calmly and reservedly about the past, rarely expressing himself passionately. I don\u2019t know if he intentionally suppresses his emotions about distant relatives. In general, for people from Chaozhou, suppressed emotions are often reflected in how they refer to their parents. There is a saying that fortune-tellers advise against being too familiar in one\u2019s address. As a result, many older Chaozhou people don\u2019t call their parents \u201cDad\u201d or \u201cMom,\u201d but use terms like \u201cA-Bai\u201d (father\u2019s side) and \u201cA-Mu\u201d (mother\u2019s side), or \u201cA-So\u201d (uncle) and \u201cA-Shen\u201d (aunt), which are terms for extended family members. Grandpa is the same. One thing is certain: the role of his father in Grandpa\u2019s life is distant. Grandpa doesn\u2019t know his stepmother\u2019s birth year. I asked, \u201cWhen was Grandma born?\u201d Grandpa replied, \u201cShe was born in the Year of the Goat.\u201d In this region, where ancestor worship and fortune-telling are common, older generations of Chaozhou people are accustomed to using the zodiac signs to refer to people\u2019s ages. When talking about someone, they rarely ask for the year, instead asking about their zodiac sign. Some people who like to buy lottery tickets might ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s his zodiac sign?\u201d when an unfamiliar guest visits, and they would then bet on that sign or its corresponding number. Some even study the mysterious patterns in the black-and-white tabloids, hoping to decipher the secrets. Grandma was surprised that Grandpa didn\u2019t know his father\u2019s age. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how old Uncle (Stepfather) is?\u201d she asked. Grandpa replied, \u201cHow would I know?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know his zodiac sign?\u201d Grandpa really didn\u2019t know his stepfather\u2019s zodiac sign. He only remembered that Grandma Ai once said she married at 18 (in the lunar age), had him at 35, and his stepmother married at 24. If Grandma Ai was born in the Year of the Goat, that would make her birth year 1907, and his stepmother would have been born around 1901, passing away at 59 in lunar years. However, in Thailand, I couldn\u2019t find confirmation of this. After much discussion, Aunties told me that his stepmother passed away at 62 lunar years, which means she was born in 1898. But the difference is not large\u2014I think it was somewhere in this range. Grandpa was studying a photo of his father, older brother, and older sister. After a long time, he chuckled softly. \u201cMy mother (Grandma Ai) used to complain about my stepfather. She\u2019d say his eyebrows were so thin, just like a pair of \u2018little eyebrows.\u2019 His two front teeth were like the teeth of a monkey. She\u2019d say his little teeth were so small, they were annoying.\u201d Grandpa smiled, his eyes turning crescent-shaped. \u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018little eyebrows\u2019?\u201d I didn\u2019t understand. \u201cIt\u2019s like a \u2018double-arched\u2019 eyebrow, but not thick,\u201d Grandpa explained. \u201cMy father had a double-arched eyebrow, but my stepfather\u2019s eyebrows were quite thick.\u201d He then recited a song that\u2019s commonly associated with women left behind by their husbands: \u201cOn the third day of the third lunar month, the soft moonlight shines, the moon hangs far in the sky; it\u2019s a moon so soft, thinking of my husband who has gone far away.\u201d In this song, the woman\u2019s heart is broken with longing, waiting for her reunion with her husband. But the man Grandma Ai talks about in the distance wasn\u2019t so positive; there was also a sense of \u201cdisdain.\u201d Grandma Ai mentioned that her husband was forgetful. While working in the garden, he would often forget tools and leave them behind. \u201cHe\u2019s such an easy-going person, very careless,\u201d Grandma Ai would say. There was a vegetable shop nearby, and the shopkeeper would often get vegetables from Grandpa\u2019s stepmother. One time, business was so good that they ran out of green onions. The shopkeeper asked Grandpa\u2019s stepmother to pick more, and she told him to go to the garden and pull up as many as he needed, then just pay the amount. But isn\u2019t it good to be honest and trusting? In Chaozhou, being too honest often results in being criticized\u2014honesty is seen as a lack of ability. There\u2019s a saying, \u201cHonesty is useless.\u201d But when these words come from Grandma Ai, is it an intentional subtlety? Is it a form of sarcasm to cover up her true feelings? Why did she say my stepfather\u2019s eyebrows were thin when they were actually thick? I can\u2019t be sure. During the time I briefly stepped away from the phone, Grandpa studied a photo of his father again. Later, I heard from a recording that he sighed and said to Grandma: \u201cMy stepfather had long ears, that\u2019s why he lived such a short life\u2014only in his fifties.\u201d I often think that if Grandpa and Grandma had gone to Thailand back then, they might not have been so lonely. Grandpa would have had his brother and sister with him, and maybe he would have been more like his sister\u2014someone who loved to laugh and chat. \u201cHave you ever thought that it would have been better if you had gone to Siam?\u201d I asked Grandpa nearly eighty years later. His gaze was fixed on the street outside, as if deep in thought, or maybe avoiding the question. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNot even once?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not that interested in Thailand,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good or bad over there. I don\u2019t know. What does a child know?\u201d Grandpa always tends to avoid the present. The sharp, blocking words from a child who didn\u2019t understand anything back then prevent me from asking further. It\u2019s hard to fathom Grandpa\u2019s inner world, his emotions about his father, and his feelings about distant places he never reached. \u201cIsn\u2019t there someone who\u2019s had it even harder than him?\u201d Grandma once shook her head, knowing Grandpa\u2019s nature. He rarely speaks about his past. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk about it to others. He keeps everything to himself.\u201d \u201cEveryone had it hard,\u201d Grandpa replied, not wanting to talk about suffering. \u201cToday\u2019s children are like this.\u201d \u201cThe big climate,\u201d Grandpa said, \u201cThe children before liberation, who had it hard? Those who suffered were few. Those who were poor became landowners after the land reform.\u201d","title":"Fractured Memories"},{"location":"history/they_are_in_siam/#the-rise-and-fall","text":"The lives of my grandparents were not the stuff of legendary tales, not like those stories of laborers in Southeast Asia who became wealthy merchants. They were part of the hidden tide of migration to the South Seas, with no grand achievements to speak of. Fate, it seems, often teased them, eroding the lives they worked hard to rebuild and maintain. But they always made a forward choice at the moment when they could change their destiny. Perhaps the results were not always ideal, perhaps they didn't receive much grace, but they never gave up. In the year after my grandfather passed away, my uncles and aunts started to marry one by one. My uncle continued to live in the old house, while my eldest aunt and her husband moved next door. My youngest uncle presided over my grandfather's wedding and even wrote a letter to our hometown in Chaozhou to inform my grandmother and grandfather of this happy news. The woman my uncle married was a Chaozhou native born in Siam, whose parents had immigrated there years earlier. My eldest aunt's husband was also from Chaozhou, but older, by twelve years. Around 1940, he left Chenghai County, leaving behind his wife and infant son, and sailed to Siam. At that time, he was in his early twenties, working as a laborer at the docks while saving money to send back home. Twenty years later, in 1960, his hometown had become a place he could never return to, so he remarried in Bangkok with my eldest aunt. Before marriage, my eldest aunt had sold vegetables, specifically different varieties from those my aunt sold. After having children, she stayed home to care for them, having six children in twelve years. When the children grew up, she was encouraged by my aunt to go back to selling vegetables until she was in her fifties. From what I know of my uncle's life, he worked as a street vendor selling fruits, tofu, fried rice cakes, and soy milk. He changed his offerings multiple times, and only stopped at the age of 70. Now my uncle lives in a quiet residential area in the northwest of Bangkok in Nonthaburi, in a two-story house. He moved here more than two years ago. He showed me around the land in front and behind the house, introducing me to the mangoes, winter melons, bananas, sour oranges, and other plants whose names I couldn\u2019t understand in Thai. When I asked him why he chose this place, he used a translation app to tell me, \"I wanted a house with space to plant trees.\" My uncle's childhood was spent in a wooden house. Behind the house was the winding Chao Phraya River, with many mosquitoes that would slip in through the cracks in the wood. At night, while sleeping, he would stretch out his hand outside the blanket, and with a slap, he could kill ten mosquitoes. When he was a teenager, the tenants of the area were forced to leave as the land was to be used for the construction of a building or \"guesthouse.\" My aunt and her husband had to find a new place, one that wasn\u2019t too far from the school where the children had to study. After much searching, they found a house near the \"Yue\" area and signed a long-term lease. Life was difficult for them. My uncle had attended a private school that cost 100 baht per semester, but when the term started, he still hadn't paid, and the teacher called out his name. His third brother studied there for two years but couldn't afford the fees, so he had to transfer to a free temple school. There was one time when the water bill collector came to the house. Normally the bill was around 10 or 20 baht a month, but this time, for some reason, it was 120 baht, which they couldn't afford, so my aunt had to borrow money. Despite the poverty, my uncle was very clear about what was good and bad. My aunt and uncle always taught their children to work diligently and not take others' money. When he was a child, one of his Chinese friends lived in a house where they sold newspapers. He would often go there to read the papers and help watch the store. When something sold, he would put the money back into the cash box. One time, another child was caught taking money and stuffing it into his pants pocket. His friend's mother, who was watching from inside the house, scolded him, \"If you do this, you're going to get in trouble!\" Some things are timeless, connected across generations. When I asked my grandfather what my grandmother taught him, his answer was always consistent: \"Your hands and feet should be clean, and when you enter someone else's house, you shouldn\u2019t touch things without permission.\" I imagine this is what my aunt was taught at home, and later, what she passed on to my uncle. In the past, my uncle remembered that Bangkok had many parks and trees, and there weren\u2019t as many roads as there are now. His parents didn\u2019t have time to watch over him, so he and his friends would run off to play. One day, his uncle saw him out on the road and shouted, \"What are you doing here? Get inside!\" My uncle replied, \"I\u2019m with my friends.\" His uncle asked, \"Are you coming to my house? Don't you want to come?\" \"Go, go,\" he said, as he hopped on his uncle\u2019s motorcycle and left. My uncle often took his third brother out on errands. He loved picking up discarded cigarette wrappers to play with. Sometimes he would also collect scrap metal to sell, earning a couple of baht for a small bag. He started earning money when he was young, about eleven or twelve years old, when he worked part-time helping a vegetable vendor at the market. He worked for half an hour or an hour a day, earning 5 baht, which added up to 35 baht a week. Earlier, he also bought homemade ice cream from a neighbor and sold it at the market, shouting, \"Ice cream is here, ice cream!\" When he was eight or nine years old, he and his friends went to the river. A cargo ship came in, and the workers unloaded large sacks of white sugar onto the boat. Some sugar spilled on the ground, and my uncle collected it in a bag, one grain at a time. When he gathered a kilogram, he could sell it for two baht. His parents didn\u2019t know he was collecting sugar. They thought it was too dangerous and forbade him to go. One time, a neighbor caught him by the river, and when his uncle found out, he took a wooden stick and went looking for him. From a distance, my uncle and his third brother saw him coming and hurriedly hid. His uncle searched around but couldn\u2019t find them and had to leave. On one occasion, my uncle and a friend gathered 35 kilograms of sugar and sold it for 70 baht, which they split. That year, when he was nine years old, he used the money to take his third and fourth brothers to eat pig's trotter rice, which cost two baht per bowl. Normally, they couldn\u2019t afford to eat it at home, so he had to earn the money himself. After selling the sugar, he felt rich, and he told his brothers, \"We can have two bowls, it\u2019s only four baht.\" He also bargained with the owner, saying, \"Why is one bowl three baht? Give me the discount, it\u2019s too much.\" \"Two baht isn\u2019t enough, I want three baht,\" he laughed. My uncle has an innate sense of humor. Later, when I met his brothers, I realized that this humor was not unique to him. His fourth brother, who also spoke with a smile, often used \"understand\" and \"okay\" as part of his conversation to ease the atmosphere. He spoke in broken English and told me his job was simple, \"Okay?\" He laughed. \"I\u2019m old now, and my memory is outdated, understand?\" he laughed again. His wife shook her head, saying, \"Confused, what is he saying?\" Sometimes, my fourth uncle was stumped by my questions, furrowing his lips and thinking hard, looking like Donald Duck. \"I don\u2019t remember,\" he said. But when I asked him about his parents\u2019 work, he became enthusiastic and wrote down his answer on a piece of paper: \"Easy question, paper paper.\" Whenever he recalls the past, Renbo speaks endlessly, and it\u2019s hard to stop his flow of words. Even though his Teochew has become rusty, he still loves to speak it, occasionally finding the right word after a little search. Sometimes, he needs to think for a while, humming and murmuring, before the word finally comes out. When he talks about his retirement, he doesn\u2019t quite know how to express it, so he uses \"graduated\" as a substitute. At times, he doesn\u2019t understand what I ask. Once, I asked him what the second aunt did before selling vegetables. He paused, leaned in with his ear, squinted his eyes, and said, \"What\u2019s that? What\u2019s that?\" This was how Renbo always reacted when he didn\u2019t understand something. I rephrased the question: \"What did the second aunt do before selling vegetables?\" He understood and replied: \"The eldest aunt said the second aunt helped her husband sell eggs, then started selling vegetables when she was a teenager. She never went to school in Siam.\" In the past, when the older generation was still around, Renbo spoke Teochew more often. \"The second aunt spoke Mandarin, which was too difficult for me, so I just spoke back in Teochew.\" He laughed again, \"Now, I don\u2019t speak Mandarin anymore. You come, I\u2019ll speak in Teochew for you.\" These days, Renbo leads a healthy lifestyle. He avoids overly sweet, salty, or cold food. He wakes up around five or six in the morning, goes downstairs to watch TV, and drinks a cup of hot honey with sour lime. In the evening, his wife goes to dance fitness classes, and he walks around the area. He still plays soccer twice a week. After turning sixty, Renbo started receiving a government pension of 600 baht per month (around 120 RMB). \"600 baht, it\u2019s not enough for one meal,\" he said with a wry smile. In comparison, he believes a government job is very good because after retirement, you can still receive your salary, and most family education and healthcare are free. However, government salaries are low. He told me that his cousin, who works as a civil servant, has been working for eight or nine years but only earns around 20,000 baht (less than 5,000 RMB). Despite this, Renbo admires the retirement benefits for civil servants and regrets not knowing these things when he was younger. When he first graduated, he never thought about working for the government. When the government was mentioned, Renbo only thought of the police, and the family didn\u2019t know there were other government jobs available. \"Chinese people do the police work, no one likes it, they\u2019re afraid to catch thieves, because the thieves have guns, it\u2019s hard,\" Renbo said. I asked him what Chinese people liked to do back then. \"Banking and selling goods,\" he replied. In Thailand, the occupational divide between Thai and Chinese people was already taking shape by the 19th and 20th centuries: Thai people were more interested in agriculture, government, and self-employment, while Chinese people favored business, industry, finance, and mining. After junior high, Renbo studied at a business college for three more years. In the early 1980s, after graduation, he worked for half a year at Hung Lee Bank, then switched to a private company in sales, where the salary was higher. His salary started at 3,000 baht, and by the time he retired, it had risen to 60,000. After his children started working, the family\u2019s situation gradually improved. Most of Renbo\u2019s brothers worked in banking and sales. Five out of six worked in banks. Some switched careers early, and others were forced to leave during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The eldest brother graduated from business college and joined Thai Commercial Bank. In 1997, he left with a severance pay of 900,000 baht, bought a house in a neighboring province, and worked as a lawyer in the banking sector for a few years. Later, he helped his wife sell drinks at a stall in the market for twenty years, which continues today. When I saw him at the market, I almost didn\u2019t recognize him. Seven years ago, his hair was still dark, but now it is nearly all white, and his face shows signs of fatigue. He\u2019s over sixty now, and recently he decided to rest and stop working, saying, \"Enough, I can\u2019t go on.\" The third and fourth brothers are university graduates. The third brother became a lawyer after leaving the bank. The fourth brother, as Grandpa said, \"has two diplomas\"\u2014he studied two years of graduate school after completing his undergraduate degree. He worked in a bank for a short time, then switched careers to become a programmer. Ten years ago, he left the bank and started his own small business. \"Before, life was hard in Tangshan, but Siam was good. Now Tangshan is good, but Siam is bad,\" Renbo often compares the two places, lamenting the economic downturn in Thailand: \"Siam loses to Tangshan, losing, losing.\" \"Now, I don\u2019t dare to spend money freely,\" he said. When he bought a car, he used savings; when he bought a house, he borrowed money from family and friends. He didn\u2019t dare to borrow money from a bank, feeling the interest rates were too high. \"The bank\u2019s money, I\u2019m afraid of it,\" he said, \"Young people nowadays are not like that, they\u2019re not afraid of loans\u2014my cousin got married two years ago, wanted to buy a new house, and borrowed over three million baht from the bank, with a 30-year loan, paying more than ten thousand baht a month.\" Renbo is cautious with money, but he is also kind. One of his childhood friends, who was a gambler and lost all his family savings, now lives a tough life. His friend calls him once in a while, saying he has no money, and Renbo always gives him some. When Renbo was still earning a salary, he would occasionally give him 1,000 baht. After retiring, when his own income dried up, he would give him 300 or 500 baht. Renbo is loyal to old friends; his friend\u2019s family was rich in the past, and they always shared what they had with him, even giving him nice clothes without asking for anything in return. In his younger years, Renbo also gambled and lost several thousand baht. He went back to his wife and said, \"Buy whatever you want, go ahead,\" and from that time on, he didn\u2019t dare to gamble anymore. \"Stopped, scared, money is hard to earn.\" A few years ago, Renbo went to Tangshan to visit his half-brother and also saw my grandparents. When his brother\u2019s family asked him how life was in Siam, he replied, \"I can eat whatever I want, there\u2019s good food. I\u2019m not rich, but I\u2019m doing fine.\"","title":"The Rise and Fall"},{"location":"history/they_are_in_siam/#visitors-from-afar","text":"When I was young, every New Year\u2019s Day, I could always hear my grandfather answering the phone. He would say it was a call from abroad. After the 1970s, connections with distant relatives slowly began to be re-established. Sister E occasionally sent care packages. The distant family members knew very little about each other and had each formed new families. Every letter became a precious opportunity to learn about one another\u2019s current situation. The letters were thin and pink, written in messy traditional Chinese characters, and were written by someone else on Sister E\u2019s behalf. Most of the letters were lost. The only surviving one is from January 1975, with 15 Hong Kong dollars enclosed. Sister E asked Grandpa, \u201cDo you know how old your eldest son is this year? Does he have any children now?\u201d Later, when acquaintances came back or went to visit relatives, Grandpa would ask them to bring local specialties for Sister E and her brother. Sister E never came back to Tangshan. Grandpa had mentioned it a few times, asking her to come and visit, but she never did. She would say that her legs weren\u2019t doing well. Uncle and Aunt would give the same excuse, \u201cNo money,\u201d \u201cThe children are studying, we need money.\u201d Grandpa\u2019s family has an old photo album on the third floor, and I often flipped through the pictures. The photos were taken during Grandpa and Grandma\u2019s first trip to Thailand in 1999. Although we had never met, I had already heard from the elders who these people were\u2014this was Grandpa\u2019s second sister, this was his eldest sister and brother, and that was their children. Before their trip to Thailand that year, Grandpa made his first phone call to his eldest sister\u2019s family. After talking to her, his second sister came on the line, and the two of them took turns speaking. Finally, the person on the other end said, \u201cAlright, don\u2019t talk too long, the phone is expensive.\u201d Back and forth, the conversation lasted half an hour, and Grandpa spent over a hundred yuan on the call. Grandpa didn\u2019t remember what they talked about during the call, but Uncle remembered. He would often bring it up, mimicking their tones. \u201cAh, brother, do you want to come to Siam?\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I want to come.\u201d \u201cHmm, when will you come? If it\u2019s on a good day, then it\u2019ll be very good.\u201d On the day they arrived in Thailand, Sister E, Uncle, and Aunt came to meet them at the airport. In the car, Uncle kept complaining. He would say that when he traveled to Siam by boat in the past, he was hungry, sick, and had a tough time all the way. He would add, \u201cBrother, you\u2019re lucky; you\u2019ve studied. When I went to get your fortune told, your fate was good.\u201d But Sister E didn\u2019t mention these things. That night when they arrived at Uncle\u2019s house, Grandma didn\u2019t come out to greet them. That day, Grandpa seemed a bit upset. He knew that his siblings-in-law\u2019s impression of relatives from Tangshan wasn\u2019t very good\u2014people from a poor place who hadn\u2019t seen each other in decades. Even though they were blood relatives, they were likely coming to ask for things. I could empathize with Grandpa\u2019s disappointment after arriving and could also understand Uncle\u2019s concerns and caution. \u201cTangshan,\u201d a distant hometown, one that doesn\u2019t need to give back but continues to receive benefits and gifts from wealthier places. People often imagine those who go to Southeast Asia returning in glory, while those left behind in poverty wait and envy the travelers, hoping to see the success they imagine they will bring. More than ten or twenty years ago, Uncle would often ask Aunt: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to go to Tangshan?\u201d Aunt would reply, \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t talk about it, I\u2019ll stay here. There\u2019s nothing good there.\u201d In the 1990s, Uncle returned to Chenghai to visit relatives; his mother and ex-wife were still there. His grandson was young and liked to watch TV, but there was none at home. Uncle\u2019s son said that Uncle didn\u2019t have the money to buy a TV. Hearing this, a few people who had traveled with him decided to pool some money together to buy a TV for his grandson. In the early 2000s, Uncle\u2019s son, who was from Tangshan, came to Thailand. He didn\u2019t have much money either. Uncle wanted to give him some, so he discussed with a few people and they decided to pool their money together. Although Uncle didn\u2019t have much money, he contributed about 3,000 to 4,000 baht. In the end, Uncle gave him over 10,000 baht. But Grandpa wasn\u2019t there to ask for anything. In 1999, Grandpa was 57 years old, and since they had been separated 53 years ago, he had never seen his eldest sister or brother. At that time, Grandpa had heard about his second sister\u2019s house burning down, and thinking of her kindness, he saved up some money and decided to go see her when a friend was visiting Thailand. In the past, wooden houses in Thailand would often catch fire, and when they did, entire rows of houses would burn down. Sister E\u2019s house had caught fire because of a neighbor\u2019s house. Uncle said there were two fires\u2014one in 1984 and another in 1998. Sister E\u2019s house was badly burned, and after it was all over, almost all of their belongings turned to ashes. They lost nearly everything, and Sister E suffered huge losses. Uncle bought her a refrigerator. Later, Sister E hired someone to rebuild, but the person didn\u2019t finish the work and ran off with the money. Grandpa and Grandma brought three jade bangles, one for each of their eldest and second sisters and their sister-in-law. For every grandchild they met, and even for the unmarried aunt at that time, they gave each person 100 Hong Kong dollars as a memento. They also gave Sister E some extra money under the pretext of helping her with the fire damage. Aunt accepted some, but Uncle felt embarrassed to accept anything. Uncle said directly, \u201cWhen others come here, they only want things, but you come here and want to share with others.\u201d He told Aunt, \u201cLook at my brother, he came all the way here, and now he\u2019s sharing money with others, while you only want to take my money.\u201d \u201cGoing this time, it changed his (Uncle\u2019s) point of view,\u201d Grandpa sighed. Seeing that their younger brother was doing well, Sister E was very happy. She had always worried about her little brother, who had been so small when they parted, and never knew how he had grown up. Grandpa and Grandma stayed at Aunt\u2019s house for one night. They stayed on the floor, with cloth curtains separating the spaces. The weather was hot and humid, and there was only one fan. Aunt\u2019s neighbors saw Grandpa and said he looked like their father. Most of the time, Grandpa and Grandma stayed at Uncle\u2019s house, which was more spacious. They went to many places together. Uncle and Aunt, along with Sister E, took Grandpa to temples and the beach. Uncle\u2019s second son, who didn\u2019t speak much Chaozhou, specially bought a dictionary and took it along when they went to the Royal Field Square. When Uncle returned from working abroad, he took a few elderly relatives out to eat hotpot. \u201cWhen Grandpa and Grandma came, Uncle was already in his thirties, still young,\u201d Uncle said with a smile. In front of buildings with tall spires and gleaming gold, they took many photos together, which they brought back to Tangshan. Uncle also took Grandpa to meet the daughter of Aunt\u2019s sister\u2014she had come to Siam early and had never met them before. They had originally wanted to visit the families of Grandpa\u2019s older brother and younger uncle, but since they hadn\u2019t been in contact for a long time, they couldn\u2019t find them in the end.","title":"Visitors from Afar"},{"location":"history/they_are_in_siam/#identity","text":"For many years, we each lived our own lives in different places. Most of the time, we did not disturb each other; but whenever we met, we treated each other with warmth and hospitality. We could be described as distant relatives, connected by blood, yet separated by language and geography. But I still feel some regret. I grew up in a small town in Chaozhou, where family and relatives were close, and interactions were frequent. Just like how Renbo often went to Aunt E's house for meals and stayed overnight at Uncle's, I too had such a childhood. Aunt E was my grandfather's closest family member, and we might have been closer, but over the long years, our relationship naturally grew distant. Even letters could not sustain or mend the bond. Renbo's family still keeps some Chinese remnants. There's a shrine to the local deity in the corner of the dining table. Every Spring Festival, Aunt E's family and several of her brothers wear red shirts with \"Happy New Year\" printed on them for a group photo, which they share in the WeChat group. Renbo\u2019s wife is a Thai, and she enjoys wearing red qipao. As for how they address each other, they still use Chaozhou dialect\u2014Aunt, Uncle, older brother, older sister-in-law, and so on. On the day Uncle Si visited Renbo\u2019s house, I overheard him call her \"Second Sister-in-law.\" But Aunt E also has many habits and customs that are unfamiliar to me. For example, Buddhism is deeply embedded in her life, and Renbo and his wife often engage in religious activities, making offerings to monks. She also follows the Thai Buddhist calendar, so whenever I ask about the year, I need to subtract 543 to get the familiar Gregorian year. Furthermore, she takes a bath twice a day; they don\u2019t use chopsticks at home, only forks and spoons; for breakfast, they eat fried rice, and they add chili to their congee. I can't help but wonder why the Chinese in Thailand integrated so quickly compared to Chinese communities in other Southeast Asian countries? There's an interesting story about a representative of the overseas Chinese who went to Southeast Asia to seek fortune. In 1810, Xu Sizhang from Zhangzhou, Fujian, went to Penang (now part of Malaysia) as a laborer, later trading in various locations, marrying a Thai woman, and eventually becoming a contractor for the tin mine taxes in the Siamese region, where he developed tin mining. Later, he was appointed by the Siamese royal family and granted an official title. His family was even given the Thai surname \"Na Lalong.\" His descendants who stayed in Thailand became Thais, while those who returned to Malaysia remained Chinese. About a hundred years ago, during the early years of the Bangkok Dynasty, wealthy Chinese elites in Siam maintained close relationships with the royal family. They became wealthy through cross-border trade, had tax collection rights, entered the bureaucracy, were granted noble titles, or even married into the royal family. Most of these tax contractors who served the Siamese elite were Chaozhou people. These upper-class Chinese were accepted by the Siamese elite and seamlessly integrated into the local political system. Meanwhile, ordinary Chinese laborers in Siam usually married local women, even if they had wives in China. The Siamese authorities were open about the identity choices for Chinese immigrants at the time. They were allowed to maintain their own cultural practices while freely adopting local customs. Mixed-race descendants could choose to identify as Chinese or Thai. The Chinese had to pay a head tax (marked with a string on their wrist and a stamp), but they were exempt from military service. Scholars have summarized that before 1910, mixed-race children with Chinese fathers and Thai mothers usually identified as Chinese, while children of mixed-race fathers\u2014whether their mothers were Thai or mixed\u2014typically identified as Thai. This means that by the third generation of Chinese immigrants, their identity and cultural affiliation were mostly Siamese. Although many Chinese had been gradually assimilated, in the early 20th century, with the acceptance of nationalism by educated Siamese elites, the spread of Chinese nationalism and communism, and Western anti-Chinese sentiment, the Siamese government began implementing a policy of Thai nationalism. This policy was intended to accelerate the assimilation of the Chinese, with external forces pushing the process. For example, the 1913 amendment to the nationality law made all Chinese born in Siam citizens of Siam. However, as Chinese migration to Siam increased after World War I, with entire families migrating together, the number of Chinese women and children also grew significantly. The number of second-generation Chinese born in Siam marrying local women decreased, slowing the pace of assimilation. As a result, after the 1930s, the Siamese elite imposed more stringent controls over Chinese language education, Chinese-language newspapers, and Chinese business practices. Numerous revisions to immigration laws restricted the entry of communists, the poor, and women. In a secret document from the National Security Council of Thailand in 1965, the government explained its goals and measures for assimilating the Chinese. The document pointed out that extreme nationalism should not be used, but rather a gentler approach should be adopted to assimilate the Chinese into loyal Thai citizens. This included encouraging intermarriage, using Thai names, offering equal rights to naturalized citizens, and establishing more Thai-language schools. These gentle policies had a direct impact on my grandfather\u2019s relatives. Today, there is almost no clear distinction between Chinese and Thai social classes in Thai society. Among the second-generation immigrants, except for Renbo, the other uncles and aunts barely speak the language of their parents. Aunt E's family no longer seeks to marry fellow Chinese as their parents did\u2014only Aunt Ying married a descendant of Chinese immigrants. By the third generation, this is even less of a concern. I am curious about how Aunt E perceives her identity and Chinese heritage. Renbo\u2019s younger brother told me that when she was a child, she had no interest in China and didn\u2019t know much about the place, except that her parents had told her it was very poor. Her parents' hometown was just a distant image to her. She couldn\u2019t speak much Chaozhou dialect and only spoke Thai at school. Her friends were all Thai. At home, she mixed the two languages, which often got her scolded by her eldest uncle: \u201cSpeak properly!\u201d The eldest uncle only knew a little Thai, and Aunt E's mother knew even less. So, when she spoke to her parents, Renbo had to act as her translator. Aunt E seamlessly integrated into Thai society and became a full-fledged Thai. On the wall near the stairs in Renbo's house, there is a picture of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej and his dog Tongda, along with another photo of his wife, Queen Sirikit. When I met her on the day she visited, she gave several yellow shirts to Renbo\u2019s family and me, with the royal emblem on the chest. Yellow is the color representing the king, and that month was the birthday month of the current king. She said, \"I can wear it when I go out to play.\" Uncles and aunts have Chinese names, but they only use them at home. Outside, for school or work, Aunt E has always used a Thai name. Renbo\u2019s former surname was \"Chen\"\u2014in fact, the eldest uncle\u2019s surname is Lin, but when he arrived in Siam, his ID card was mistakenly swapped, and upon landing in Siam, he became a \"Chen.\" From that moment on, the surname \"Chen\" was always on his and his children\u2019s identification cards. In his thirties, Renbo decided to change his surname to a Thai one. He said, \"When Chinese people come to Siam, what they need most is to change their surname\u2014just by seeing your surname, they know you\u2019re a local, not a foreigner. Locals are easier to deal with.\" Of his six brothers, three changed to Thai surnames. From 1982 to around 1990, the Thai government received about 10,000 applications per year to change surnames, 90% of which were from Chinese people; in addition, about a thousand Chinese immigrants became Thai citizens each year. Renbo selected three possible surnames and went to the district office several times to complete the paperwork. The staff rejected his requests for various reasons. On the final attempt, Renbo slipped 200 baht into the staff's hand. The staff member sighed, looking troubled yet scrutinizing the surname seriously, then said, \"This one is too common, can't use it... this one, this one is good! Just a regular one, a couple of bows, and it\u2019ll do, about a month\u2019s wait. Afterward, just bring me money, and I\u2019ll say, \u2018Good, good, good, you found the right surname!\u2019\" Renbo shook his head and refused to pay, insisting the process should be done without bribery. Over forty years ago, Aunt E became a Thai citizen and also changed her surname. But Uncle, Aunt E\u2019s eldest sister, and her eldest brother-in-law didn\u2019t change their surnames, so Aunt E has always lived in Thailand as a foreigner. Grandpa once asked Uncle about it, and he said, \"I\u2019m Chinese, what\u2019s the point of changing nationality?\" But not being a Thai citizen has its inconveniences. Since Uncle wasn\u2019t Thai, he had to use Aunt E\u2019s name to buy land and build a house. After turning 60, he also didn\u2019t receive the government\u2019s pension. When Aunt E was still selling vegetables, life was manageable. After she turned 60, she stopped selling and began receiving government aid. Renbo would give her some extra money each month, initially 500 or 700 baht, later 1,000 baht. \"I know in my heart,\" she said. \"When you grow up, you understand what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not.\" She also said that it wasn\u2019t her parents who taught her to do this. \"Chinese and foreigners are not the same. Foreigners don\u2019t understand... but maybe not, percentage-wise it\u2019s different.\" The cause of Aunt E\u2019s death isn\u2019t very clear to Grandpa. Renbo spoke to him about it a few years ago, but Grandpa couldn\u2019t understand his Chaozhou dialect. Renbo later told me via a translation app that it was a stomach perforation. Before coming to Thailand this time, my family asked me to bring some dried shiitake mushrooms, morel mushrooms, hawthorn, and old citron. Grandpa said that people there like these, and in the past, when foreign guests returned, they always brought these items back. When we arrived at Renbo\u2019s house, Aunt E saw the mushrooms and said, \"Second Aunt loves these. She often asked me to go to Chinatown to buy them.\" When Renbo worked abroad, Aunt E would call him every month. If she wanted to eat Chinese goods or needed offerings for ancestor worship, she would have Renbo buy them. \"She loves to eat these, so I go and buy the best ones for her.\" Aunt E would speak very quickly, never hanging up the phone for less than half an hour. She\u2019d ask Renbo, \"Have you transferred the money yet? Have you transferred it yet?\" Uncle would reply, \"I\u2019ll transfer it next week. You go to Yaowarat and buy ginkgo nuts and red dates for Aunt.\"","title":"Identity"},{"location":"history/they_are_in_siam/#farewell","text":"I came to Siam, to the places where Aunt E once stepped. I was able to rediscover her distant story and felt genuinely happy for her from the bottom of my heart. Aunt E is a good person\u2014ordinary, honest, and living a simple, earnest life. After the death of her eldest brother-in-law twenty years ago, her mental and physical health deteriorated, and she developed Alzheimer's disease. When she was happy, she liked to talk about the past\u2014saying, \u201cIn the past, I knew; but now, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Aunt E would reminisce, \u201cIn the old days, when someone hit my little sister, I would fight back.\u201d Renbo asked her about her younger brother. She recalled that someone had asked her to go to Tangshan to find him, but it was hard to locate him, and she didn\u2019t succeed. Aunt E also remembered that Grandpa had come to Thailand many years ago\u2014twenty years ago. Renbo asked, \u201cWould you like to go to Tangshan? Or not?\u201d She replied, \u201cNo, no, nothing good to eat there.\u201d She only responds to others when in a good mood. When she\u2019s upset, she becomes impatient, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t talk, don\u2019t talk, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\u201d She gets upset if there are too many people, or if the noise around her is too loud. If too many things are said at once, she also becomes unhappy. Her sons would try to say good things to her at home, teaching her to say, \u201cHappy New Year, wish you prosperity!\u201d When the eldest uncle said the first part, Aunt E would always finish with the second part. In 2021, Aunt E passed away during the COVID-19 pandemic at the age of 91. Grandpa passed away more than a decade ago due to a stroke. Grandma is still alive, now 85, but she also has Alzheimer\u2019s disease. She is currently unable to care for herself and is being looked after by caregivers in the hospital, bedridden. In 2003, she visited Chaozhou to see relatives and stayed at my house. After that visit, Grandpa planned to return to see her, but he never did. We flipped through the black-and-white photos Aunt E brought. For each elderly relative\u2014Mother, Aunt E, Grandpa, and others\u2014Aunt E gave me a copy to take home, saying, \u201cTake them to Tangshan and show them around.\u201d The grave of Mother\u2019s mother is located in the southern part of Bangkok, in the Nakhon Pathom province, on a small piece of land next to other people's graves. This cemetery is mostly filled with Chinese people, Renbo told me. Every year during Qingming (Tomb Sweeping Day), Aunt E and Grandpa would visit to pay respects to their father. Because of her leg problems, Aunt E would go only occasionally. Renbo began accompanying Aunt E on these visits when he was around nine years old. At first, they took a bus, transferring three or four times to reach the cemetery. Later, as more people joined, about ten in total, they hired a vehicle to go there. After the graves were cleaned, they would head south to Bangsaen Beach to relax. Since then, Renbo almost always joined the trip, except during the two years of the pandemic. When Renbo took me to the cemetery that day, everything was quiet. The only sound was the rustling of our feet through the overgrown grass. This place likely only becomes lively during Qingming. The gravestones were closely packed together\u2014some hidden behind thick grass, others with inscriptions completely faded, perhaps from years of neglect. The gravestones indicated the hometowns of the deceased, almost all from the Eight Regions of Chaozhou. People from different dialect groups were buried together. We walked through grass that reached up to our calves and knees to reach the grave of Mother\u2019s mother. The inscription listed her origin as \"Puyin, Egongkeng, Xiang,\" meaning a village in Chaozhou. The gravestone had been renovated by Grandpa more than a decade ago, with dragon and phoenix paintings on either side, and lotus flowers. In front of the grave was a stone platform, decorated with a fruit tray. There was no wild grass around this grave, and the grass on the mound was neatly trimmed. The name of Aunt E's mother was also engraved on the stone, even though she wasn't buried here. \"Grandpa, your grandson has come from Tangshan to visit you,\" Renbo said.","title":"Farewell"},{"location":"history/The%20unchanging%20and%20the%20ever-changing/content/","text":"The Unchanging and the Ever-Changing What Confucians call China, vast though it may seem, Is but one of eighty-one parts in the world's grand scheme.

The general belief, particularly based on Confucian classics, is that the \"Nine Provinces\" refers to the nine regions of China that were created after the great Yu the Great (\u5927\u79b9) controlled the flood, in order to manage and govern the country more effectively. However, according to existing historical records and archaeological findings, there is no concrete evidence that Yu and his era ever existed. Even if he did exist, the rulers at that time could not have governed such a large area directly. Therefore, this concept remained an ideal, a reflection of a vision, not a practical reality. Moreover, this concept gradually evolved in the late Warring States period. Scholars of that time saw the trend of the eventual unification of the country and made plans for future governance, envisioning a unified state. However, this vision was never put into practice. Whether it was the establishment of the \"Thirteen Provinces\" during the Western Han Dynasty or the implementation of the Provincial Governor system during the Eastern Han Dynasty, the country was never divided into nine provinces. Nonetheless, this concept was continuously used, such as in the poem by Lu You, \"But sorrow for not seeing the Nine Provinces united.\" Here, the \"Nine Provinces\" symbolized the entire country of China. Even today, we often use \"Nine Provinces\" to represent the entire nation. Therefore, some historical concepts remain confined to the intellectual realm, or over time, people have treated these ideas as practical concepts, which still hold real significance and a positive impact. So, how did these concepts come about? Most were based on existing realities, but some were purely the result of scholars' logical reasoning or imaginative speculation, which could still solve practical problems and have an impact in history or science. For instance, the Records of the Grand Historian (\u53f2\u8bb0) records the scholar Zou Yan from the state of Qi, who lived after Mencius. He believed that \"What the Confucians call China is actually only one eighty-first of the world. China is called 'the Red County Divine Land' (\u8d64\u53bf\u795e\u5dde). Within this Red County Divine Land, there are nine provinces, the ones that Yu the Great divided, but these do not represent the actual number of provinces. Outside China, there are nine other regions like the Red County Divine Land, surrounded by seas, where people and animals cannot communicate with one another, and each such region is considered one province. In this way, there are nine provinces, and outside these, there is the vast ocean surrounding the world, marking the boundaries of heaven and earth.\" Zou Yan\u2019s concept was audacious and unprecedented. Based on existing historical records, Zou Yan likely never left the region of Qi, let alone visit the nine provinces, let alone the larger concept of the \"Great Nine Provinces.\" Why did he propose such a grand idea? It was purely imagination and reasoning. However, looking at the reality of the earth today, Zou Yan\u2019s reasoning seems surprisingly accurate. Each continent is surrounded by oceans, and the concept of the seven continents or five continents we use today is essentially the idea of a landmass surrounded by water. The concept of \"Nine Provinces\" was not the result of fieldwork by Zou Yan but was born from his imagination and reasoning. Yet, this concept undoubtedly has more positive meaning than knowledge gained solely from practical observation or description of places that one had visited. In fact, Western geographers were similar. The earliest people to hypothesize that the Earth was round or spherical did so without any fieldwork. Before the Age of Exploration, no one truly understood the world or the surface of the Earth. It was not just the remote places on Earth that were unknown; even within one\u2019s own continent, few people had traveled extensively or understood the geography. How, then, did they establish large-scale geographical concepts? It was also through imagination and reasoning. We notice that during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods in China, various philosophies began to emerge and even reached high levels of development. This was because it was a time of intellectual freedom, or rather, the rulers were either too busy or unable to intervene in the realms of thought and scholarship. Brilliant individuals were able to make significant discoveries through their rich imagination and rigorous logic. A famous example is the well-known saying by Zhuangzi, which our national leaders often quote in international forums: \"A one-foot stick, take half of it every day, and it will never be exhausted.\" Over two thousand years ago, there were no scientific experiments, no electron microscopes to observe the micro-world, nor nanotechnology or particle accelerators. Zhuangzi had none of these tools\u2014so how could he claim that a one-foot stick, if you took half of it every day, would never be exhausted? How could he explain the infinite divisibility of matter in just twelve words? In fact, this is the result of free thought. His statement was not based on empirical evidence or scientific experiments, but purely on rigorous reasoning. If you take half each day, you would have half left, then half of that, and so on. If you say one day it would be gone, then where did the other half go? Therefore, it should never be exhausted. Another example is the famous debate on the proposition \"A white horse is not a horse.\" This was a sophism, but it became an important logical proposition in academic circles. Gongsun Long emphasized that \"white horse\" is composed of two concepts\u2014white and horse\u2014and both are essential. If you only have a horse, it could be yellow, black, or other colors, but if you have \"white,\" it does not necessarily have to be connected to a horse. In the concept of \"white horse,\" both white and horse are inseparable; otherwise, it is neither white nor a horse, and thus \"not a horse.\" Although this debate seemed meaningless in practical terms, it could freely occur at the time, and would be recorded and passed down, becoming part of a school of thought. The reason for this is that in an era where intellectual and academic thought was not controlled, brilliant individuals, especially some geniuses, could fully apply and display their talents. This freedom of thought was not due to a conscious effort by the rulers to encourage intellectual freedom, nor was it the result of any formal institutions. It can be attributed to an important factor: the free movement of talent. During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the existing order was breaking down, and individuals with skills, who dared to pursue personal development, had the freedom to move. At the same time, faced with intense and brutal conflict, if rulers wanted to protect themselves or achieve further expansion, they needed a group of outstanding talents, and they could not rely solely on their own people. They had to actively recruit from foreign lands. For talents, this meant freedom of choice and mobility. If one country did not value them, they could move to another. A regime that was good at attracting and absorbing talented individuals, particularly immigrants, had the potential to rapidly develop, expand, and consolidate. Many famous stories from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods tell of rulers who spared no expense in attracting talent. The state of Qin was particularly effective in this. Almost all of the people who contributed greatly to the rise of Qin, promoted legal reforms, or carried out important missions were immigrants. Some were from the Western Rong, some from Wei, some from Song, others from the state of Wu, and so on. These individuals had been marginalized or unimportant in their home countries. It was only in Qin that they found opportunities to succeed. However, the rulers of Qin did not always prioritize the recruitment of immigrants. On the one hand, there was a pressing need for talent, and on the other, decisions needed to be made by the ruler. Once, the Qin royal ministers suggested that most of the immigrants who came to Qin served their original masters, and they recommended expelling them. After Qin Shi Huang issued the \"Expulsion Order\" to expel the immigrants, Li Si, who was a guest official, wrote the famous \"Memorial on Expelling Foreigners,\" arguing that if Qin had not accepted the \"guests\" (immigrants), it would never have become as powerful as it was. By expelling them, the Qin would only help their enemies, making many enemies and accumulating resentment. This led Qin Shi Huang to change his mind and revoke the expulsion order, allowing the \"guests\" to stay, including Li Si. But when all talents belong only to one country, when they can no longer make their own choices, intellectual and academic freedom ceases to exist.","title":"The Great Nine Provinces and A Foot-long Ruler"},{"location":"history/The%20unchanging%20and%20the%20ever-changing/part_1_ch_1_sec_1/#the-great-nine-provinces-and-a-foot-long-ruler","text":"Back to contents In Chinese history, there are some concepts that have been used for a long time but never became a reality, such as the well-known \"Nine Provinces\" (\u4e5d\u5dde).

Gongsun Long emphasized that \"white horse\" is composed of two concepts\u2014white and horse\u2014and both are essential. If you only have a horse, it could be yellow, black, or other colors, but if you have \"white,\" it does not necessarily have to be connected to a horse. In the concept of \"white horse,\" both white and horse are inseparable; otherwise, it is neither white nor a horse, and thus \"not a horse.\" Although this debate seemed meaningless in practical terms, it could freely occur at the time, and would be recorded and passed down, becoming part of a school of thought. The reason for this is that in an era where intellectual and academic thought was not controlled, brilliant individuals, especially some geniuses, could fully apply and display their talents. This freedom of thought was not due to a conscious effort by the rulers to encourage intellectual freedom, nor was it the result of any formal institutions. It can be attributed to an important factor: the free movement of talent. During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the existing order was breaking down, and individuals with skills, who dared to pursue personal development, had the freedom to move. At the same time, faced with intense and brutal conflict, if rulers wanted to protect themselves or achieve further expansion, they needed a group of outstanding talents, and they could not rely solely on their own people. They had to actively recruit from foreign lands. For talents, this meant freedom of choice and mobility. If one country did not value them, they could move to another. A regime that was good at attracting and absorbing talented individuals, particularly immigrants, had the potential to rapidly develop, expand, and consolidate. Many famous stories from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods tell of rulers who spared no expense in attracting talent. The state of Qin was particularly effective in this. Almost all of the people who contributed greatly to the rise of Qin, promoted legal reforms, or carried out important missions were immigrants. Some were from the Western Rong, some from Wei, some from Song, others from the state of Wu, and so on. These individuals had been marginalized or unimportant in their home countries. It was only in Qin that they found opportunities to succeed. However, the rulers of Qin did not always prioritize the recruitment of immigrants. On the one hand, there was a pressing need for talent, and on the other, decisions needed to be made by the ruler. Once, the Qin royal ministers suggested that most of the immigrants who came to Qin served their original masters, and they recommended expelling them. After Qin Shi Huang issued the \"Expulsion Order\" to expel the immigrants, Li Si, who was a guest official, wrote the famous \"Memorial on Expelling Foreigners,\" arguing that if Qin had not accepted the \"guests\" (immigrants), it would never have become as powerful as it was. By expelling them, the Qin would only help their enemies, making many enemies and accumulating resentment. This led Qin Shi Huang to change his mind and revoke the expulsion order, allowing the \"guests\" to stay, including Li Si. But when all talents belong only to one country, when they can no longer make their own choices, intellectual and academic freedom ceases to exist.","title":"\"The Great Nine Provinces\" and \"A Foot-long Ruler\""},{"location":"history/The%20unchanging%20and%20the%20ever-changing/part_1_ch_1_sec_2/","text":"How Large Was Ancient China? Back to contents Previously, we discussed the concept of \"China\" and how it evolved over more than three millennia to become the formal name of our nation. But what exactly was the process of this evolution? And how large was ancient China? These are questions that people often ask. When we study, learn about, or explain the history of ancient China, we need to define a specific scope. It is insufficient to determine the boundaries of China solely based on how large people at the time perceived it to be. For example, when studying the history of the Shang Dynasty, we cannot limit our research to the capital of the Shang Dynasty, even though the people of that time referred to it as \"China.\" We must study the entire Shang Dynasty, including its ruled territory, its interactions with surrounding areas, and those who dealt with it. Thus, \"China\" is, in fact, a concept defined by later generations. In the 1950s and 1960s, my teacher, Professor Tan Qixiang, was tasked with compiling and drawing The Historical Atlas of China. He encountered the problem of how extensive the coverage of each map should be for different historical periods, from primitive society to the Qing Dynasty. What range should be depicted to reflect the history of ancient China? For written works, this is easier as descriptions can provide explanations. However, maps require a specific spatial scope. Where should the northern, southern, eastern, and western boundaries be? There must be precise definitions. Moreover, there was no existing methodology for delineating such a concept. Initially, Tan was assigned to \"revise and redraw\" Yang Shoujing's Maps of Successive Dynasties, published in the late Qing and early Republican periods. However, Yang's approach was rooted in traditional concepts. \"Successive dynasties\" referred only to specific historical dynasties, such as the Han or Tang, and he only mapped the territory controlled by these dynasties. He did not include the regimes established by non-Han ethnic groups or border regions outside the central dynasties. Consequently, some areas within today's Chinese territory were omitted. If Tan were to continue using Yang's approach, the historical contributions of various ethnic groups to the formation of Chinese history would not be fully reflected. Some suggested that since this was a historical atlas of China, the maps should depict the territory of the People's Republic of China. However, this suggestion was clearly unfeasible and did not align with historical facts. For instance, over a million square kilometers of land north of the Heilongjiang River, east of the Ussuri River, and in northwestern Xinjiang were ceded to Tsarist Russia. Similarly, over a million square kilometers of Outer Mongolia, which were territories of the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, were only recognized as independent in 1946. If the maps were limited to the territory of the People's Republic of China, these changes would not be evident, nor would they reflect the facts of Chinese history. Additionally, historical China, even excluding regimes established by non-Han peoples, encompassed territories beyond today\u2019s boundaries. For example, during the Han Dynasty, its territory included central Korea and northern and central Vietnam. At its peak, the Tang Dynasty\u2019s western frontier extended to the Aral Sea. The Yuan Dynasty also controlled vast areas outside today\u2019s borders. Limiting maps to modern China would leave the maps of the Han, Tang, Yuan, and almost all other central dynasties incomplete, thus failing to represent the spatial scope of Chinese history accurately. This suggestion was quickly rejected. Another proposal was to use Yang's approach, mapping only the territory controlled and governed by the central dynasties at the time. For instance, maps of the Han Dynasty would only depict its governed areas, regardless of how far they extended beyond modern China's boundaries. The same would apply to the Tang and Yuan. However, this method also failed to reflect the historical reality, particularly the contributions of various ethnic groups and border regimes to Chinese history. Until the Qing Dynasty achieved unification, some areas within today's Chinese territory, such as the Tibetan Plateau, were not under the control of central dynasties. Tibet became part of the Yuan Dynasty in the mid-13th century when the Mongols unified it. If maps only depicted central dynasties, regions like Tibet would be excluded from pre-Yuan maps, making it impossible to illustrate the shared contributions of various ethnic groups to Chinese history. Before the mid-13th century, Tibetan people and their regimes had long interacted and even clashed with central dynasties and other ethnic groups of China. The relationships between Tibetan Plateau peoples and central dynasties were undoubtedly part of Chinese history. For instance, the Tang Dynasty\u2019s relationship with Tibet, whether in friendly marriage alliances like Songtsen Gampo and Princess Wencheng or in conflicts and counter-expansions, as well as Tibet\u2019s interactions with Nanzhao, Dali, Xinjiang, and Central Asia, were all significant aspects of Chinese history. Maps that only showed Tang territory would omit these events, presenting an incomplete history and ignoring the contributions of non-central dynasties and border regimes to Chinese history. After extensive research, consultation with historians and related academic fields, and approval from the central authorities, Professor Tan established the principle: The territorial scope of China from the mid-18th century, after the Qing Dynasty achieved unification in 1759, until the mid-19th century before the imperialist invasions, represents the historical development of China\u2019s territory. All ethnic groups active within this range during historical periods are considered part of Chinese history, and their regimes are regarded as part of historical China. Specifically, the unified territory established in 1759 during Emperor Qianlong\u2019s reign, after pacifying the regions south and north of the Tianshan Mountains, serves as the historical benchmark. This territory extended from the Outer Xing\u2019an Mountains, Ergune River, and Mongolian Plateau in the north, to Lake Balkhash and the Pamir Plateau in the west, including the southern border and South China Sea islands, and to the Pacific in the east, including Sakhalin, later occupied by Tsarist Russia. This scope, encompassing about 13 million square kilometers, is the historical extent of China. This range was not chosen because it was the largest. Although the Qing Dynasty\u2019s unified territory was indeed substantial, larger territories existed, such as the Tang Dynasty, whose western boundary once reached the Aral Sea, or the Han Dynasty, which included most of Vietnam and parts of the Korean Peninsula. The Qing\u2019s territory was chosen because it represents a culmination of thousands of years of historical development. Additionally, while some dynasties controlled larger territories, the Qing Dynasty was the only one to implement effective governance throughout its domain. For territories beyond the Qing\u2019s unified range, historical maps and studies adapt based on the context. For example, maps of the Han Dynasty include parts of present-day Vietnam and Korea, while maps of the Tang Dynasty extend westward to the Aral Sea. Similarly, for regimes established by non-Han peoples or border regimes straddling this boundary, the political center serves as the main criterion. For instance, the Koguryo regime, which straddled Northeast China and the Korean Peninsula, was considered part of Chinese history before its capital moved to Pyongyang. After this relocation, it was treated as an external regime. Thus, to determine the historical extent of China, one standard is the unified territory of the Qing Dynasty after 1759, covering about 13 million square kilometers. Another standard is based on the historical concept of China, encompassing the territories of central dynasties, their interactions with non-Han regimes, and regions yet to be governed. This is a complex task since territorial boundaries varied across dynasties and even within the same dynasty. The most convenient way to explore this is by referring to The Historical Atlas of China, edited by Professor Tan Qixiang and published by the China Cartographic Publishing House. This eight-volume series includes general maps for each historical period, depicting territorial changes over time, and detailed sectional maps for specific areas. There is also a concise version, A Concise Atlas of Chinese History, which compiles the general maps into one volume, with descriptions outlining the formation and changes of each period\u2019s territory, administrative divisions, and historical context. It also includes an index of place names, making it highly practical for study.","title":"How Large Was Ancient China?"},{"location":"history/The%20unchanging%20and%20the%20ever-changing/part_1_ch_1_sec_2/#how-large-was-ancient-china","text":"Back to contents Previously, we discussed the concept of \"China\" and how it evolved over more than three millennia to become the formal name of our nation.

Back to contents In the previous section, I discussed the geographical scope of Chinese history as defined by later generations. In this section, I will focus on what \"China\" meant in the minds of people of the time\u2014specifically, the extent of the territories under the control of the Central Plains dynasties. You may have noticed that when referring to the domains of ancient dynasties, I use the term \"territory\" (\u7586\u57df) instead of \"sovereign land\" (\u9886\u571f), as the two concepts are distinct. Ancient Chinese territorial boundaries were based on the concept of \"all land under heaven belongs to the king.\" The sky was above, and all land below was considered \"under heaven,\" with China at its center. Hence, the ruler could decide the extent of his domain. The term \"\u7586\" (boundary) refers to a border or demarcation, while \"\u57df\" (domain) indicates a spatial range. This range was determined by the supreme ruler of the time\u2014be it a king, a son of heaven, or an emperor. Modern national borders are quite different. They are not unilaterally determined but accepted by neighboring countries and protected under international law. They represent an equal relationship between nations and delineate territory that includes airspace, territorial waters, and the subsoil beneath the land and sea. In ancient times, such concepts did not exist. Without aircraft, the idea of airspace was irrelevant; without advanced ships and artillery, the notion of territorial waters was not feasible. Another distinction lies in the concept of sovereignty. Today, sovereignty over a country's territory is unequivocal. However, in ancient China, territorial ownership did not always come with a clear sense of sovereignty. For instance, nomadic peoples often lacked a defined territorial concept. They moved according to the availability of water and pasture, claiming areas as their own when needed and using force to seize them if necessary. Central Plains dynasties sometimes ceded control of certain regions to vassal states or neighboring regimes, viewing it as a matter of administrative delegation rather than relinquishing sovereignty, as all land was considered part of the \"under heaven.\" The term \"territory\" was used to describe the area under governance in ancient China, and this term persists today instead of \"sovereign land.\" The evolution of China's territory is too complex to address every dynasty, regime, or era. Instead, I'll focus on a few representative stages: The Qin Dynasty The first critical stage begins with Emperor Qin Shi Huang's unification of the Six States. Before this, during the Shang, Zhou, and earlier dynasties, no central authority governed all regions. Qin Shi Huang consolidated the territories of the Six States in 221 BCE, though this was not yet Qin's largest extent. Following the conquest of southern Chu and the Yue territories, Qin expanded into parts of modern Zhejiang and Fujian. By 215 BCE, General Meng Tian drove the Xiongnu out of the Ordos Loop, establishing new administrative districts like Jiuyuan Commandery. By the time of Qin Shi Huang's death in 210 BCE, the Qin Empire spanned from the Ordos Plateau, Yin Mountains, and Liao River in the north to northeastern Vietnam in the south, and from the Longshan Mountains in the west to the Korean Peninsula in the east. This marked China's first vast, unified territory. The Han Dynasty The Han Dynasty expanded upon the Qin's foundation. During Emperor Wu's reign, significant territorial expansions culminated in 60 BCE with the establishment of the Western Regions Protectorate. By the late Western Han, the stable territory stretched north to the Yin Mountains and Liao River, east to parts of the Korean Peninsula, south to northern and central Vietnam, and west to the Pamirs and Lake Balkhash. Compared to modern China, the Han's territory excluded three key areas: the Tibetan Plateau, the Mongolian Plateau, and northeastern regions beyond the Liao River. These areas were unsuitable for agriculture at the time, making them less strategically necessary. The Tang Dynasty The Tang Dynasty, particularly in its early years, witnessed unprecedented expansion. Key milestones include: 630 AD: The defeat of the Eastern Turks extended control to areas beyond the modern northern border. 640 AD: The conquest of Gaochang led to administrative divisions in present-day Xinjiang. 657 AD: Victory over the Western Turks pushed boundaries to the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers. 668 AD: The conquest of Goguryeo led to the establishment of the Andong Protectorate in modern Pyongyang. However, the Tang's territorial reach often depended on military campaigns rather than sustained administration. For instance, the Andong Protectorate in Korea was quickly withdrawn, and Western territories retreated after the An Lushan Rebellion, leaving Central Asia open to Tibetan expansion. The Yuan Dynasty Under Genghis Khan and his successors, the Yuan Dynasty unified vast regions, surpassing previous dynasties in both size and administrative reach. The Yuan governed territories from the Irtysh River in the west to the Sea of Okhotsk in the east and from northern Korea to the Himalayas in the south. Administrative divisions, including provincial systems, were established even in previously ungoverned regions like Mongolia and northern Manchuria. The Qing Dynasty The Qing Dynasty reached its territorial peak under Emperor Qianlong in 1759, encompassing over 13 million square kilometers. However, subsequent conflicts, such as the Opium Wars, led to significant territorial losses. By the late Qing era, territories like Outer Mongolia declared independence, and treaties with Russia further reduced China's landmass. These stages illustrate how the concept of \"territory\" evolved in Chinese history, reflecting changing geopolitical and administrative realities. Each dynasty adapted its governance to the practical needs of its time while shaping the historical boundaries of China.","title":"How Did the Territory of Ancient China Change Over Time?"},{"location":"history/The%20unchanging%20and%20the%20ever-changing/part_1_ch_1_sec_3/#how-did-the-territory-of-ancient-china-change-over-time","text":"Back to contents In the previous section, I discussed the geographical scope of Chinese history as defined by later generations.

Back to contents In the sixth year of Emperor Wu of Han's Yuanding reign (111 BCE), Emperor Wu embarked on an inspection tour. When he arrived at Tongxiang in Zuoyi County, he received the joyous news that the Nanyue Kingdom had been pacified. Delighted, he renamed the county Wenxi (literally, \"Heard the Joy\"), which is now Wenxi County in Shanxi Province. Later, upon reaching Xinzhong Township in Ji County, he learned that the rebel leader L\u00fc Jia had been captured. To commemorate this, he established a new county named Huojia (literally, \"Captured Jia\"), which is today's Huojia County in Henan Province. These two counties have a history of over 2,100 years, but the concept of counties dates back even earlier. Counties first appeared in the late Warring States period. By the Qin Dynasty, there were already several hundred counties, with some estimates suggesting there may have been over a thousand. Among these, a portion has remained stable in name and administrative seat for over two millennia. The administrative structure of counties has also remained relatively stable. By the end of the Western Han Dynasty, around the beginning of the Common Era, there were over 1,500 county-level administrative units in China. Today, China has about 2,800 such units, despite its territory being significantly larger and its population over 20 times that of the Han Dynasty. Why Are Counties Stable? Counties have been the most stable administrative units throughout the evolution of China's administrative divisions. They are the basic level of governance, directly managing local populations. A county's size and jurisdiction must align with its administrative functions, which have remained largely unchanged for over two thousand years. In an agrarian society with limited transportation, a county's jurisdiction couldn't be too large, or it would be unmanageable. If the population grew, taxes increased, and administrative responsibilities expanded, new counties would be established, or existing ones divided. Conversely, if population and taxes decreased, some counties would be merged or abolished to reduce administrative costs. As a result, both the number and boundaries of counties have been relatively stable. The term \"county\" itself has never changed, except in certain special regions or areas inhabited by ethnic minorities. Origin of Counties In the feudal system, the land was directly managed by kings and lords. Large lords would often delegate smaller fiefs to subordinates, and these subdivisions had no administrative needs beyond tribute. However, during the Warring States period, the Zhou king lost control over the lords, leading to annexations. Large states absorbed smaller states, and rulers began directly managing the annexed territories rather than redistributing them as fiefs. These directly managed territories, often at the edges of central lands, were called \"xian\" (counties), derived from the word \"xuan,\" meaning \"hanging,\" as they were on the outskirts. Rulers appointed officials to govern these areas. As the number of counties grew, their names were differentiated with specific identifiers, such as Wenxi and Huojia. Counties were thus products of the decline of feudalism and the rise of centralized administration. Emergence of Prefectures and Provinces By the late Warring States period, with the rapid expansion of territories, it became challenging for rulers to directly manage all counties. This led to the establishment of prefectures (jun) to oversee counties. After Qin Shi Huang unified China in 221 BCE, the empire was divided into 36 prefectures, which were later adjusted to about 50 by the dynasty's end. Under the Han Dynasty, particularly during Emperor Wu\u2019s reign, territorial expansion led to the creation of over 100 prefectures. To manage these, 13 inspectorates (cishi bu) were established, which evolved into a higher administrative tier overseeing prefectures and counties. Later Developments Over time, administrative systems evolved further: Tang Dynasty: Introduced \"dao\" (circuits) as a supervisory tier above prefectures. Song Dynasty: Replaced \"dao\" with \"lu\" (routes), emphasizing administrative over supervisory functions. Yuan Dynasty: Established \"xing zhongshu sheng\" (provincial-level administrative regions), laying the groundwork for the modern province system. Ming and Qing Dynasties: Standardized the provincial system, dividing the empire into provinces, each managing several prefectures and counties. Throughout these changes, counties remained the foundational administrative unit. Adjustments were primarily driven by population changes, tax revenue, and administrative needs. Conclusion Over 2,000 years of administrative evolution demonstrate the enduring utility of the county system, first formalized under the Qin Dynasty. Despite changes in higher-level administrative structures and names, the essence of centralized governance through counties has remained consistent, reflecting its adaptability to China\u2019s vast territory and population.","title":"How Did Ancient Central Governments Divide Major Administrative Regions?"},{"location":"history/The%20unchanging%20and%20the%20ever-changing/part_1_ch_1_sec_4/#how-did-ancient-central-governments-divide-major-administrative-regions","text":"Back to contents In the sixth year of Emperor Wu of Han's Yuanding reign (111 BCE), Emperor Wu embarked on an inspection tour. When he arrived at Tongxiang in Zuoyi County, he received the joyous news that the Nanyue Kingdom had been pacified. Delighted, he renamed the county Wenxi (literally, \"Heard the Joy\"), which is now Wenxi County in Shanxi Province. Later, upon reaching Xinzhong Township in Ji County, he learned that the rebel leader L\u00fc Jia had been captured. To commemorate this, he established a new county named Huojia (literally, \"Captured Jia\"), which is today's Huojia County in Henan Province. These two counties have a history of over 2,100 years, but the concept of counties dates back even earlier. Counties first appeared in the late Warring States period. By the Qin Dynasty, there were already several hundred counties, with some estimates suggesting there may have been over a thousand. Among these, a portion has remained stable in name and administrative seat for over two millennia. The administrative structure of counties has also remained relatively stable. By the end of the Western Han Dynasty, around the beginning of the Common Era, there were over 1,500 county-level administrative units in China. Today, China has about 2,800 such units, despite its territory being significantly larger and its population over 20 times that of the Han Dynasty.","title":"How Did Ancient Central Governments Divide Major Administrative Regions?"},{"location":"history/The%20unchanging%20and%20the%20ever-changing/part_1_ch_1_sec_4/#why-are-counties-stable","text":"Counties have been the most stable administrative units throughout the evolution of China's administrative divisions.

In an agrarian society with limited transportation, a county's jurisdiction couldn't be too large, or it would be unmanageable. If the population grew, taxes increased, and administrative responsibilities expanded, new counties would be established, or existing ones divided. Conversely, if population and taxes decreased, some counties would be merged or abolished to reduce administrative costs. As a result, both the number and boundaries of counties have been relatively stable.

However, a few months later, after listening to the suggestion of Lou Jing, a frontier soldier, and receiving the support of Zhang Liang, he decided to relocate the capital to Guanzhong. At that time, most of Liu Bang's followers were his old acquaintances from Feng and Pei\u2014his hometown region (modern Feng County and Pei County in Jiangsu Province). They opposed the move. Additionally, the former Qin capital, Xianyang, had already been destroyed. Upon relocating to Guanzhong, there was initially no place to reside. They temporarily settled in what is now Lintong, and only moved to the new capital after its construction was completed. This new capital was named Chang\u2019an, which was originally the name of a local township with auspicious connotations. Thus, early on, this relocation was simply referred to as \"moving to Guanzhong.\" Why did Liu Bang make this decision, and why did the Western Han capital remain in Chang\u2019an? The location of a capital is critical for both internal stability and external defense. Externally, the capital must be situated to address major military threats. If a capital is too far from the frontline or not positioned to confront the main adversary, it becomes impossible to contain threats proactively. This could lead to abandoning or relocating the capital in times of weakness. Conversely, situating the capital near key threats compels rulers to continually strengthen defenses and maintain a proactive stance, ensuring national security. During the Western Han, the primary military threat came from the Xiongnu in the north and northwest. In the early Han period, beacon fires were frequently lit at Ganquan Palace (near modern Chunhua County, Shaanxi Province) to warn of Xiongnu raids. Xiongnu cavalry could reach within 800 li (approximately 400 km) of Chang\u2019an, close enough for a one-day march. With Chang\u2019an as the capital, the Western Han consistently fortified the surrounding area, defending the northern and northwestern frontiers. By the reign of Emperor Wu, the Han launched counterattacks that expelled the Xiongnu from Han territory, secured the Great Wall line, and expanded into the Hexi Corridor using Guanzhong as a base. Liu Bang\u2019s decision to make Chang\u2019an the capital proved highly effective for external defense. Internally, the capital must control domestic forces and prevent rebellions. In the era of cold weaponry, a relatively enclosed and defensible environment was ideal. A capital should also be located in a geographically advantageous position to facilitate offensives if needed. In this regard, Chang\u2019an was far superior to Luoyang. The terrain around Luoyang was flat, with low mountains and broad pathways, making it difficult to defend. By contrast, Guanzhong, where Chang\u2019an is located, was known as a \"land of four barriers.\" To the north were the Loess Plateau and mountain ranges, to the south was the Qinling Mountains, to the west were the Long Mountains and the Longdong Plateau, and to the east, the Qinling and Huashan Mountains closely bordered the Wei and Yellow Rivers. This basin, surrounded on all sides, was highly defensible. Key passes such as Tongguan, Hangu Pass, Wuguan, and Xiaoguan secured the limited access routes, making the area easy to defend and difficult to attack. Additionally, the position offered a commanding advantage over the densely populated and economically developed Central Plains, enabling proactive offensives. Strategically, Guanzhong was a stronghold. In the early Western Han, much of the Central Plains was not under direct imperial control, with large fiefdoms occupied by feudal lords. By building the capital in Chang\u2019an, the Han could consolidate Guanzhong as its base while securing territories to the west, north, and southwest, such as Hanzhong and Bashu (modern Sichuan). In cases of rebellion in the Central Plains, Chang\u2019an provided security for the capital while enabling counterattacks once sufficient forces were mobilized. For example, during the Rebellion of the Seven States in 154 BCE, General Zhou Yafu successfully suppressed the uprising. With the secure rear base of Guanzhong and the loyal Liang Kingdom blocking access routes, Zhou Yafu was able to concentrate forces and defeat the rebels within three months. Thus, making Chang\u2019an the capital proved advantageous for both external defense and internal control. Why did the Eastern Han capital remain in Luoyang? Emperor Guangwu (Liu Xiu) of the Eastern Han established Luoyang as the capital, and it remained so throughout the dynasty, except for a brief relocation to Chang\u2019an under Duress during Dong Zhuo's regime. Calls to relocate the capital back to Chang\u2019an persisted, reflecting Chang\u2019an\u2019s enduring influence. However, Luoyang retained its status as the capital. Why? A common explanation is that Liu Xiu, whose power base was in Nanyang (modern Nanyang City, Henan Province), relied on the support of local elites there. Placing the capital in Luoyang, closer to Nanyang, made it easier to maintain this support. While true for the early Eastern Han, this factor alone does not explain the broader strategic preference for Luoyang. A more critical factor was the ease of food supply. Capitals inevitably gather large populations, including the royal family, officials, soldiers, and other non-agricultural workers. By the mid-Western Han, Chang\u2019an and its surrounding counties housed over a million people. However, the limited agricultural capacity of the Guanzhong Plain could not meet the growing demands of the capital. Despite being fertile, Guanzhong\u2019s farmland was constrained by urban expansion, palace construction, and military needs. The region increasingly relied on grain imports from the Central Plains, which required costly and perilous transport along the Yellow and Wei Rivers. In contrast, Luoyang, located closer to the Central Plains, faced fewer logistical challenges. Grain transport to Luoyang was shorter, avoided the treacherous Sanmenxia Gorge, and was more reliable. Consequently, while Chang\u2019an suffered from severe grain supply issues, Luoyang did not face such difficulties throughout the Eastern Han. Changes in military conditions also favored Luoyang. After Dou Xian defeated the Northern Xiongnu in 91 CE, they migrated westward, and the Southern Xiongnu, who had submitted to the Han, posed no major threat. However, rebellions by the Qiang people in the northwest became frequent, making Chang\u2019an a frontier city rather than a secure capital. By the late Eastern Han, much of northern Guanzhong had fallen out of Han control, becoming a region inhabited by Qiang, Xiongnu, and other nomadic groups. Under such conditions, Chang\u2019an would not have been a viable capital. Conclusion The choice of a capital depends on both external and internal conditions. While Chang\u2019an excelled in earlier periods for defense and internal control, Luoyang's strategic location and logistical advantages better suited the Eastern Han\u2019s circumstances.","title":"Chang'an and Luoyang of the Han Dynasty"},{"location":"history/The%20unchanging%20and%20the%20ever-changing/part_1_ch_2_sec_1/#changan-and-luoyang-of-the-han-dynasty","text":"Back to contents After Liu Bang defeated Xiang Yu and ascended to the throne as emperor, he initially made Luoyang his capital.

Emperor Xiaowen (Tuoba Hong) of the Northern Wei announced his plans for a southern campaign. By the eleventh of August, Emperor Xiaowen led an army of 300,000 southward from the capital, Pingcheng (modern-day Datong, Shanxi). At the time, the Northern Wei had unified northern China, with the South represented by the Southern Dynasties, roughly divided by the Huai River and Qinling Mountains, resulting in a standoff between the two sides. Emperor Xiaowen's hurried southern expedition naturally caused discontent among the officials. However, since it was a command from the emperor, they had no choice but to comply. Soon after leaving Pingcheng, the army encountered continuous rain, making the journey difficult. By September 22, they reached Luoyang. Despite the muddy roads caused by the persistent rain, Emperor Xiaowen ordered the army to continue their march south on the 28th. The next morning, as he prepared to depart in full armor, a group of ministers, who had been waiting, knelt before his horse and begged him to halt the southern campaign. Emperor Xiaowen angrily demanded, \"I am about to unify the world\u2014why are you stopping me?\" However, all of his ministers, including the Tuoba royal family and military officials, blocked his path and urged him not to continue. In truth, Emperor Xiaowen did not actually intend to conduct a southern campaign. He saw the timing as a political opportunity and addressed his ministers: \"Look at the scale of this action. If it bears no result, how can I explain it to future generations? If I turn back now, what legacy will I leave? Our ancestors have lived in the northern deserts for generations\u2014do you think they don't want to move south to enjoy endless prosperity? Only the noble men of today have such thoughts, but they must wait until the right time comes. If we do not march south, we should consider moving the capital here to the central region. This is the right moment to do so.\" After stating his position, Emperor Xiaowen thought all ministers would agree. However, many of them moved to the right, opposing the move. At that point, Tuoba Zhen, who had been stripped of his title as Prince of Nanan for corruption, saw an opportunity to gain favor. He boldly exclaimed, \"Great undertakings need not be discussed with ordinary people; only exceptional people can achieve extraordinary things. Moving the capital to the central region to strengthen the royal lineage is what the Duke of Zhou did, and now His Majesty is doing the same\u2014it is entirely appropriate. What is more important than the capital? What is more important than life itself? We must stop the southern campaign and move the capital to Luoyang. This will bring peace to the emperor and happiness to the people.\" A group of officials, already prepared, shouted in support, and the ministers reluctantly followed suit. Emperor Xiaowen seized the moment to announce the move of the capital to Luoyang. This was just the first victory in Emperor Xiaowen's reforms. His main objective in moving the capital was not only to position the political center in the heart of the Central Plains for future unification but, more importantly, to achieve complete and thorough sinicization. Once the capital move was decided, he implemented a series of even more drastic measures. On the second of December, Taihe 18 (494 AD), he first issued a decree banning the wearing of \"barbarian clothes\" (the attire of the Xianbei and other northern tribes). Most Xianbei people resisted, and many failed to comply, including Duke Dongyang (formerly King Dongyang) and the Grand Tutor Tuoba Pi, who openly wore barbarian clothes. On the 19th of March, Taihe 19 (495 AD), Emperor Xiaowen's father-in-law, Grand Tutor and Duke of Jingzhao, Feng Xi, passed away in Pingcheng. Tuoba Pi, who was in charge of Pingcheng, did not support the move of the capital and, along with other ministers such as Lu Rui, wrote to Emperor Xiaowen requesting his return to Pingcheng for Feng Xi's funeral. Emperor Xiaowen saw through their intentions and harshly condemned them: \"When I first moved the capital, you had such ideas to trap me into doing something unjust.\" He demoted these ministers and ordered Feng Xi's body to be brought to Luoyang for burial. On May 26, Emperor Xiaowen announced another sinicization policy: \"No more speaking Xianbei; all must speak the correct language (Central Plains Chinese). Those over thirty may find it difficult to change immediately, but court officials under thirty must not speak Xianbei. Anyone who refuses to comply will be demoted or dismissed.\" He also scolded the officials in Luoyang: \"Yesterday, I saw women wearing the barbarian-style clothes with narrow collars. Why did you not follow my previous decree?\" The ministers could only admit their faults and beg for mercy. On June 2, Emperor Xiaowen issued an official edict prohibiting the use of Xianbei language in court, with violators facing dismissal. Soon after, King Guangchuan passed away, and since his wife had died earlier and was buried in Pingcheng, the authorities sought Emperor Xiaowen's instructions on where to bury him. Emperor Xiaowen introduced a new reform, declaring that anyone who had migrated from Pingcheng and its surroundings to Luoyang should be buried in the northern hills of Luoyang, specifically Mang Mountain. On June 19, he issued an official decree stipulating that migrants from the north, regardless of their original homeland or ethnic background, should all be considered natives of Luoyang. In the first month of the 20th year of Taihe (496 AD), Emperor Xiaowen took the most radical step in his sinicization policy by changing his own family's surname from Tuoba to Yuan. The \"Yuan\" character in the Book of Changes symbolizes the supreme force, making it the most fitting for the royal family. He decreed that all officials, including the Xianbei and other northern ethnic groups, should adopt new surnames, such as Ba and Changsun, Daxi and Xi, Yi and Shusun, among others. The difference between Xianbei and Han surnames was completely erased. At the same time, he encouraged intermarriage between the Xianbei and Han people by commanding representatives from the four highest-ranking northern families\u2014Fan Yang's Lu Min, Qinghe's Cui Zongbo, Xingyang's Zheng Xi, and Taiyuan's Wang Qiong\u2014to send their daughters to the imperial harem. Li Chong, from the prominent Longxi Li family, also arranged marriages between his children and prominent Xianbei families. Emperor Xiaowen even arranged for his six younger brothers to marry into powerful Han families, further blurring the lines between Xianbei and Han bloodlines. These radical measures were not without opposition, and Emperor Xiaowen did not expect his eldest son, the crown prince Yuan Xun, to defy his orders. Yuan Xun, who disliked studying, was overweight, and found the hot summers in Luoyang unbearable, often expressed a desire to return to Pingcheng. He secretly wore Xianbei clothes, disobeying the emperor's orders. His teacher, Gao Daoyue, admonished him, but Yuan Xun grew resentful. On the seventh of August, during Emperor Xiaowen's visit to Song Mountain, Yuan Xun conspired with his followers to kill Gao Daoyue and secretly prepared to flee back to Pingcheng. Fortunately, General Yuan Yan intercepted them and prevented their escape. Emperor Xiaowen rushed back to Luoyang, personally interrogated Yuan Xun, and, in a fit of anger, had him beaten over a hundred times with a bamboo rod, before imprisoning him and intending to depose him as crown prince. However, those opposed to Emperor Xiaowen's reforms sought to use the crown prince, and in the 21st year of Taihe (497 AD), Emperor Xiaowen, in order to prevent future threats, ordered the execution of his fifteen-year-old son. Despite his early death at the age of thirty-three, Emperor Xiaowen's reforms were irreversible. His reign marked the most active and thorough process of sinicization by a non-Han ethnic ruler in Chinese history. Though the Xianbei as a distinct ethnic group ceased to exist, their legacy lived on through the Yuan family, formerly the Tuoba clan. Even after enduring civil wars and political upheavals, the descendants of the Yuan family continued to thrive, producing prominent figures such as the poet Yuan Zhen, and many other distinguished scholars and officials, demonstrating the lasting impact of Emperor Xiaowen's reforms. While the Xianbei people as a distinct ethnic group disappeared, their contributions to the Han people and Chinese civilization were significant. Today, the Han people, as the dominant ethnic group in China, owe much of their population growth to the contributions of the Xianbei and other northern ethnic groups. Despite the Xianbei no longer existing as a separate group, their integration into the larger Han family ensured their eternal legacy. We should honor the ancestors of the Han people, but also remember the ancestors of all ethnic groups, including the Xianbei, and the great contributions made by figures like Emperor Xiaowen to the formation and flourishing of the Chinese nation. His decision to move the capital was not merely a relocation but a deliberate and strategic reform to integrate the Han culture, ultimately achieving remarkable success.","title":"The Northern Wei Emperor Xiaowen\u2019s Capital Relocation and Sinicization"},{"location":"history/The%20unchanging%20and%20the%20ever-changing/part_1_ch_2_sec_2/#the-northern-wei-emperor-xiaowens-capital-relocation-and-sinicization","text":"Back to contents In the seventeenth year of the Taihe era of the Northern Wei (493 AD), on the tenth of July, a nationwide martial law was declared, and the entire army was mobilized.

At the time, the Northern Wei had unified northern China, with the South represented by the Southern Dynasties, roughly divided by the Huai River and Qinling Mountains, resulting in a standoff between the two sides. Emperor Xiaowen's hurried southern expedition naturally caused discontent among the officials. However, since it was a command from the emperor, they had no choice but to comply. Soon after leaving Pingcheng, the army encountered continuous rain, making the journey difficult. By September 22, they reached Luoyang. Despite the muddy roads caused by the persistent rain, Emperor Xiaowen ordered the army to continue their march south on the 28th. The next morning, as he prepared to depart in full armor, a group of ministers, who had been waiting, knelt before his horse and begged him to halt the southern campaign. Emperor Xiaowen angrily demanded, \"I am about to unify the world\u2014why are you stopping me?\" However, all of his ministers, including the Tuoba royal family and military officials, blocked his path and urged him not to continue. In truth, Emperor Xiaowen did not actually intend to conduct a southern campaign. He saw the timing as a political opportunity and addressed his ministers: \"Look at the scale of this action. If it bears no result, how can I explain it to future generations? If I turn back now, what legacy will I leave? Our ancestors have lived in the northern deserts for generations\u2014do you think they don't want to move south to enjoy endless prosperity? Only the noble men of today have such thoughts, but they must wait until the right time comes. If we do not march south, we should consider moving the capital here to the central region. This is the right moment to do so.\" After stating his position, Emperor Xiaowen thought all ministers would agree. However, many of them moved to the right, opposing the move. At that point, Tuoba Zhen, who had been stripped of his title as Prince of Nanan for corruption, saw an opportunity to gain favor. He boldly exclaimed, \"Great undertakings need not be discussed with ordinary people; only exceptional people can achieve extraordinary things. Moving the capital to the central region to strengthen the royal lineage is what the Duke of Zhou did, and now His Majesty is doing the same\u2014it is entirely appropriate. What is more important than the capital? What is more important than life itself? We must stop the southern campaign and move the capital to Luoyang. This will bring peace to the emperor and happiness to the people.\" A group of officials, already prepared, shouted in support, and the ministers reluctantly followed suit. Emperor Xiaowen seized the moment to announce the move of the capital to Luoyang. This was just the first victory in Emperor Xiaowen's reforms. His main objective in moving the capital was not only to position the political center in the heart of the Central Plains for future unification but, more importantly, to achieve complete and thorough sinicization. Once the capital move was decided, he implemented a series of even more drastic measures. On the second of December, Taihe 18 (494 AD), he first issued a decree banning the wearing of \"barbarian clothes\" (the attire of the Xianbei and other northern tribes). Most Xianbei people resisted, and many failed to comply, including Duke Dongyang (formerly King Dongyang) and the Grand Tutor Tuoba Pi, who openly wore barbarian clothes. On the 19th of March, Taihe 19 (495 AD), Emperor Xiaowen's father-in-law, Grand Tutor and Duke of Jingzhao, Feng Xi, passed away in Pingcheng. Tuoba Pi, who was in charge of Pingcheng, did not support the move of the capital and, along with other ministers such as Lu Rui, wrote to Emperor Xiaowen requesting his return to Pingcheng for Feng Xi's funeral. Emperor Xiaowen saw through their intentions and harshly condemned them: \"When I first moved the capital, you had such ideas to trap me into doing something unjust.\" He demoted these ministers and ordered Feng Xi's body to be brought to Luoyang for burial. On May 26, Emperor Xiaowen announced another sinicization policy: \"No more speaking Xianbei; all must speak the correct language (Central Plains Chinese). Those over thirty may find it difficult to change immediately, but court officials under thirty must not speak Xianbei. Anyone who refuses to comply will be demoted or dismissed.\" He also scolded the officials in Luoyang: \"Yesterday, I saw women wearing the barbarian-style clothes with narrow collars. Why did you not follow my previous decree?\" The ministers could only admit their faults and beg for mercy. On June 2, Emperor Xiaowen issued an official edict prohibiting the use of Xianbei language in court, with violators facing dismissal. Soon after, King Guangchuan passed away, and since his wife had died earlier and was buried in Pingcheng, the authorities sought Emperor Xiaowen's instructions on where to bury him. Emperor Xiaowen introduced a new reform, declaring that anyone who had migrated from Pingcheng and its surroundings to Luoyang should be buried in the northern hills of Luoyang, specifically Mang Mountain. On June 19, he issued an official decree stipulating that migrants from the north, regardless of their original homeland or ethnic background, should all be considered natives of Luoyang. In the first month of the 20th year of Taihe (496 AD), Emperor Xiaowen took the most radical step in his sinicization policy by changing his own family's surname from Tuoba to Yuan. The \"Yuan\" character in the Book of Changes symbolizes the supreme force, making it the most fitting for the royal family. He decreed that all officials, including the Xianbei and other northern ethnic groups, should adopt new surnames, such as Ba and Changsun, Daxi and Xi, Yi and Shusun, among others. The difference between Xianbei and Han surnames was completely erased. At the same time, he encouraged intermarriage between the Xianbei and Han people by commanding representatives from the four highest-ranking northern families\u2014Fan Yang's Lu Min, Qinghe's Cui Zongbo, Xingyang's Zheng Xi, and Taiyuan's Wang Qiong\u2014to send their daughters to the imperial harem. Li Chong, from the prominent Longxi Li family, also arranged marriages between his children and prominent Xianbei families. Emperor Xiaowen even arranged for his six younger brothers to marry into powerful Han families, further blurring the lines between Xianbei and Han bloodlines. These radical measures were not without opposition, and Emperor Xiaowen did not expect his eldest son, the crown prince Yuan Xun, to defy his orders. Yuan Xun, who disliked studying, was overweight, and found the hot summers in Luoyang unbearable, often expressed a desire to return to Pingcheng. He secretly wore Xianbei clothes, disobeying the emperor's orders. His teacher, Gao Daoyue, admonished him, but Yuan Xun grew resentful. On the seventh of August, during Emperor Xiaowen's visit to Song Mountain, Yuan Xun conspired with his followers to kill Gao Daoyue and secretly prepared to flee back to Pingcheng. Fortunately, General Yuan Yan intercepted them and prevented their escape. Emperor Xiaowen rushed back to Luoyang, personally interrogated Yuan Xun, and, in a fit of anger, had him beaten over a hundred times with a bamboo rod, before imprisoning him and intending to depose him as crown prince. However, those opposed to Emperor Xiaowen's reforms sought to use the crown prince, and in the 21st year of Taihe (497 AD), Emperor Xiaowen, in order to prevent future threats, ordered the execution of his fifteen-year-old son. Despite his early death at the age of thirty-three, Emperor Xiaowen's reforms were irreversible. His reign marked the most active and thorough process of sinicization by a non-Han ethnic ruler in Chinese history. Though the Xianbei as a distinct ethnic group ceased to exist, their legacy lived on through the Yuan family, formerly the Tuoba clan. Even after enduring civil wars and political upheavals, the descendants of the Yuan family continued to thrive, producing prominent figures such as the poet Yuan Zhen, and many other distinguished scholars and officials, demonstrating the lasting impact of Emperor Xiaowen's reforms. While the Xianbei people as a distinct ethnic group disappeared, their contributions to the Han people and Chinese civilization were significant. Today, the Han people, as the dominant ethnic group in China, owe much of their population growth to the contributions of the Xianbei and other northern ethnic groups. Despite the Xianbei no longer existing as a separate group, their integration into the larger Han family ensured their eternal legacy. We should honor the ancestors of the Han people, but also remember the ancestors of all ethnic groups, including the Xianbei, and the great contributions made by figures like Emperor Xiaowen to the formation and flourishing of the Chinese nation. His decision to move the capital was not merely a relocation but a deliberate and strategic reform to integrate the Han culture, ultimately achieving remarkable success.","title":"The Northern Wei Emperor Xiaowen\u2019s Capital Relocation and Sinicization"},{"location":"history/The%20unchanging%20and%20the%20ever-changing/part_1_ch_2_sec_3/","text":"The Two Capitals of the Sui and Tang Dynasties Back to contents In the history of Chang'an as the capital, the Tang Dynasty can be said to be the most glorious period, both in terms of the city's scale and its influence on the nation and regions beyond China. However, after the Tang Dynasty, no other dynasty ever built its capital in Chang'an. What was the reason for this? In fact, during the early Tang Dynasty and even during the Sui Dynasty, the rulers had already realized the crisis of Chang'an as a capital, primarily due to the old issue\u2014food and material supply. A review of historical records reveals the following: In the 14th year of the Kaihuang era (594 AD), there was a great drought in Guanzhong, leading to famine. Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty led the people to seek food in Luoyang. In the first year of the Xianheng era (670 AD), there was a famine in Guanzhong, and an imperial decree allowed the people to go to various provinces for food. In the second year (671 AD), due to the previous year\u2019s drought and famine, Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty went to Luoyang. In the first year of the Yongchun era (682 AD), there was famine in Guanzhong, and soldiers were sent to various provinces like Deng and Sui to get grain. Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu went to Luoyang, where many officials and civilians died of hunger on the way. Emperors of the Sui and Tang Dynasties, including Emperor Yang of Sui, Emperor Gaozong of Tang, Empress Wu, and Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, often resided in Luoyang or traveled frequently between Chang'an and Luoyang. Empress Wu even moved the capital to Luoyang, renaming it \"Shendu\" (Divine Capital). The term \"seeking food\" refers to the act of going to places where food aid was distributed. This was because food supply in Guanzhong was already quite tight. A large portion of the grain was transported from the Yellow River Basin east of the Taihang Mountains, flowing upstream through the Sanmen Gorge and then into the Wei River, which was also navigated upstream to Chang'an. Whenever there were natural disasters or crop failures in Guanzhong, the demand for food would rise significantly. Transporting enough grain to the capital in a short period of time was extremely difficult, and the cost was high. It was easier for the emperor to lead the people to Luoyang, where food supply was more accessible. Compared to Chang'an, this approach was more convenient and economical. Thus, the Sui Dynasty built several large granaries in Luoyang. The largest, Hanjia Granary, located in the northern part of today's Luoyang, was established in the first year of the Daye era (605 AD). During the Tang Dynasty, large amounts of grain were stored there, making it a major state granary. Archaeological excavations confirm that the granary was 612 meters long from east to west, 710 meters wide from north to south, covering an area of more than 430,000 square meters, and had over 400 circular storage pits. The large pits could store more than 10,000 bushels of grain, and even the smaller ones could hold thousands. In the eighth year of the Tianbao era (749 AD), the total grain storage reached about 5.83 million bushels. It has often been said that Emperor Yang of the Sui, Emperor Gaozong of Tang, Empress Wu, and Emperor Xuanzong of Tang preferred to live in Luoyang or frequently traveled between Chang'an and Luoyang because they enjoyed pleasure, or because the environment in Luoyang was better than in Chang'an. However, if the motive was simply personal pleasure, the emperor and empress would not have lacked luxury in Chang'an. For state visits, a short trip would suffice. But living in Luoyang, even without bringing large numbers of people, could certainly save some of the costs of transporting grain from Luoyang to Chang'an. During the Western Han Dynasty, grain supply to Guanzhong came from the eastern part of the country, specifically the Yellow River basin and the Shandong Peninsula. By the early Sui and Tang Dynasties, much of it came from the Huai River basin. After the An Lushan Rebellion, due to the impact of war in the north and the influx of new settlers in the south, which increased labor and promoted agricultural production, the source of grain for Guanzhong shifted from the northern Yellow River region to the Jianghuai region and the south of the Yangtze River. After Emperor Yang of Sui opened the canal from Luoyang to Jiangdu (modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), it became easier to transport grain and other essentials from the Jianghuai and Jiangnan regions to Luoyang, but the conditions for transporting goods from Luoyang to Chang'an remained unchanged. As a result, Guanzhong became even more dependent on the Jianghuai canal system. In the second year of the Zhenyuan era (786 AD) of Emperor Dezong of Tang, in order to bypass the natural obstacle of Sanmen Gorge and reduce transport losses, Li Mi suggested building an 18-mile road between the Jijin granary east of the gorge and the Sanmen granary west of it. This would allow grain to be loaded onto carts first, then shipped around the gorge and brought to Chang'an. Although this was more labor-intensive, it was still better than losing grain and lives due to shipwrecks. In April of that year, the grain in Guanzhong ran out, and there was a danger of mutiny in the imperial army. Fortunately, 30,000 bushels of rice from Jiangnan were delivered to Shanxian (modern Sanmenxia, Henan). Upon hearing the news, Emperor Dezong joyfully ran to the Eastern Palace and said to the crown prince, \"The rice has arrived in Shanxian. Father and son are saved.\" In the first year of the Xingyuan era (784 AD), due to the rebellion of Li Xilie, the Jianghuai canal system was blocked, forcing a detour. Wang Shao was forced to escort a shipment of silk and garments to the temporary residence of Emperor Dezong in Liangzhou (modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). Emperor Dezong, overjoyed, personally expressed his gratitude, saying, \"The soldiers still have no spring clothes, but I am still wearing fur garments.\" This was in May. By the fourth year of the Tianfu era (904 AD) of the Tang Dynasty, Zhu Wen forced Emperor Zhaozong and the people of Chang'an to relocate to Luoyang, destroying the palaces and residences in Chang'an. The wood and building materials were transported by the Wei and Yellow Rivers to Luoyang, and Chang'an became a ruin. Luoyang replaced Chang'an as the capital, but three years later, Zhu Wen seized the Tang dynasty throne and established the Later Liang dynasty, moving the capital to Bianzhou (modern Kaifeng) and renaming the former Eastern Capital of Luoyang as the Western Capital. During the Five Dynasties period, the capital was effectively moved to Kaifeng, a trend that was continued by the Northern Song Dynasty. If the fall of Chang'an had only resulted in the destruction of the palaces and the city, it would not have been difficult to restore it after the wars ended. Rebuilding a new city with the strength of the entire nation would not have been hard, as Chang'an and Luoyang had been rebuilt several times before. But after the Tang Dynasty, no dynasty ever returned to Chang'an as its capital, and there were other reasons for this. While the city could have been restored after the war, in fact, by the time of the Five Dynasties and the Song Dynasty, the capital not only did not return to Chang'an, but also moved from Luoyang to Kaifeng. After Zhao Kuangyin established the Song Dynasty, he continued to use Kaifeng as the capital. From a military standpoint, Kaifeng had no natural defenses, making it vulnerable to attack, as seen in the late Northern Song period when the Jin army advanced southward and quickly surrounded Kaifeng. Zhao Kuangyin, a military man, would have known that such a situation was risky. The real concern, however, was the food and material supply to the capital. By the early Northern Song Dynasty, the economic center, particularly the grain-producing areas, had shifted to the Jianghuai region and south of the Yangtze River. The capital now depended more on supplies from the south than ever before. In this regard, Kaifeng was more favorable than Luoyang. The waterway system connected to the Huai River and the Yangtze River, along with the flat plains along the route, reduced transportation costs, ensuring the supply of food and goods to Kaifeng. Zhu Yuanzhang, upon founding the Ming Dynasty, knew that Nanjing was too far south, but for the time being, he chose it as the capital because the Yuan Dynasty still held Beijing. After he took the capital, he realized that Nanjing was too far south for a unified nation. In the first year of the Hongwu era (1368 AD), he declared Nanjing as the capital. However, by the second year (1369 AD), he sought advice from his ministers about a possible move to other locations, including Guanzhong, Luoyang, and Kaifeng. Ultimately, he decided that Nanjing was the most strategic location due to its access to vital waterways. Although Zhu Yuanzhang had initially planned to move the capital to Zhongdu (modern Fengyang), by 1375, the plan was abandoned due to logistical challenges. In 1378, he abandoned Kaifeng as a potential capital due to issues with the canal system. In the later years of his reign, Zhu Yuanzhang considered relocating the capital to Guanzhong, but after sending his son to investigate, he abandoned the idea, likely realizing that Guanzhong was not ideal either. This left the solution of the capital city to his successors. In conclusion, during the unified periods before the Yuan Dynasty, the most suitable capital location was in the central plains of the Yellow River Basin. The trend was from west to east, with capitals moving along the line of Xi'an\u2014Luoyang\u2014Kaifeng. The decisive factor was ensuring a reliable food supply and transport routes. After the Yuan Dynasty, the capital moved to Beijing, further from the primary grain-producing areas, but new transport routes were established. Zhu Yuanzhang, however, did not manage to select the ideal capital and left the decision to his successors.","title":"The Two Capitals of the Sui and Tang Dynasties"},{"location":"history/The%20unchanging%20and%20the%20ever-changing/part_1_ch_2_sec_3/#the-two-capitals-of-the-sui-and-tang-dynasties","text":"Back to contents In the history of Chang'an as the capital, the Tang Dynasty can be said to be the most glorious period, both in terms of the city's scale and its influence on the nation and regions beyond China.

In some cases, dynasties moved their capitals during their reigns, and the original capital often held a secondary capital status. Some emperors lived outside the capital for extended periods or did not officially relocate the capital, in which case the emperor's residence was called \"xingzai\" (temporary capital), meaning a provisional capital. However, the Ming Dynasty was unique in establishing two capitals. The administrative divisions of the Ming Dynasty were akin to today's provincial units and were called the Two Capitals and Thirteen Provincial Governors' Offices, with Beijing and Nanjing as the two capitals, plus thirteen provinces. How did this dual capital system come about? As mentioned earlier, Zhu Yuanzhang, the founding emperor of the Ming Dynasty, recognized that for a unified empire, Nanjing was not an ideal capital. However, he never found or built an ideal new capital, so he stayed in Nanjing. Unable to move, he expanded the capital's direct jurisdiction\u2014the \"capital district.\" In the Yuan Dynasty, the area north of the Yangtze River was under the jurisdiction of the Henan and Jiangbei provinces, while the south was governed by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang provinces. Zhu Yuanzhang centered his governance around Nanjing, incorporating what is today Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shanghai into the \"Capital District\" (Jing Shi Zhi Li), even temporarily including Jiaxing from Zhejiang. Later, he realized that this was too small and returned the area to Zhejiang. His hometown, Haozhou (modern-day Fengyang, Anhui), was first established as Lin Hao Prefecture, later renamed Zhongli Prefecture, and eventually became Anhui's Fengyang Prefecture. To ensure his hometown enjoyed the capital's status and imperial favor, it was incorporated into the Nanjing district. After Zhu Yuanzhang's death, the throne passed to his deceased son\u2019s heir, the grand prince Zhu Yunwen (Emperor Jianwen). Zhu Yuanzhang's fourth son, Prince Yan Zhu Di, was stationed in Beiping (modern-day Beijing), the former capital of the Yuan Dynasty. In the following year, 1399, Zhu Di rebelled under the pretext of \"Jingnan\" (pacifying the south), and by 1402, he had taken the capital. Emperor Jianwen died in a fire, and Zhu Di ascended the throne, becoming Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty. In the first month of 1403, Zhu Di officially renamed Beiping to Beijing and established the Shuntian Prefecture in February. He set up various governing bodies in Beijing and ordered the construction of palaces there in 1406. By 1409, Zhu Di personally moved to Beijing, leaving his son in Nanjing to govern. However, Zhu Di continued to travel back and forth between Beijing and Nanjing until 1417, when he finally left Nanjing for Beijing permanently. In 1420, he decreed that Beijing would become the capital, officially declaring the transfer of the capital from Nanjing to Beijing. The relocation of the capital to Beijing seemed natural, considering Zhu Di\u2019s long residence in Beiping and his military base there. Moreover, Beijing's location was strategic for confronting the remnants of the Yuan Dynasty in the north and preventing Mongol invasions. The decision proved to be a correct strategic choice, but why did the process take so long? The explanation in the early years could be the need for building infrastructure and palaces, but after that, the delay cannot be explained by conventional reasoning. In 1424, Zhu Di died on a military campaign, and his son, Emperor Renzong, ascended the throne. In 1425, he announced the relocation of the capital to Nanjing, and all Beijing departments were renamed \"xingzai\" (temporary capital). However, Emperor Renzong died shortly afterward, and his successor, Emperor Xuanzong, ruled for ten years, during which time Beijing remained the capital. It wasn\u2019t until 1441, during the reign of Emperor Yingzong, that the capital was officially confirmed as Beijing, and the departments were no longer called \"xingzai.\" From then on, the dual capital system remained in place until the fall of the Ming Dynasty. Nanjing continued to enjoy capital status, functioning almost identically to Beijing. The imperial palace and royal sites in Nanjing were preserved, and major state functions, such as ceremonies, decrees, and government announcements, were held simultaneously in both capitals or first in Beijing and then in Nanjing. The imperial punishment system also applied in Nanjing, where the local officials carried out punishments in the same manner as in Beijing. Nanjing maintained all administrative structures, but the officials there were largely ceremonial, symbolic, and non-executive, with no real power. For example, the \"Minister of Defense\" in Nanjing was essentially a ceremonial role with no actual duties.

In some cases, dynasties moved their capitals during their reigns, and the original capital often held a secondary capital status. Some emperors lived outside the capital for extended periods or did not officially relocate the capital, in which case the emperor's residence was called \"xingzai\" (temporary capital), meaning a provisional capital. However, the Ming Dynasty was unique in establishing two capitals. The administrative divisions of the Ming Dynasty were akin to today's provincial units and were called the Two Capitals and Thirteen Provincial Governors' Offices, with Beijing and Nanjing as the two capitals, plus thirteen provinces. How did this dual capital system come about? As mentioned earlier, Zhu Yuanzhang, the founding emperor of the Ming Dynasty, recognized that for a unified empire, Nanjing was not an ideal capital. However, he never found or built an ideal new capital, so he stayed in Nanjing. Unable to move, he expanded the capital's direct jurisdiction\u2014the \"capital district.\" In the Yuan Dynasty, the area north of the Yangtze River was under the jurisdiction of the Henan and Jiangbei provinces, while the south was governed by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang provinces. Zhu Yuanzhang centered his governance around Nanjing, incorporating what is today Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shanghai into the \"Capital District\" (Jing Shi Zhi Li), even temporarily including Jiaxing from Zhejiang. Later, he realized that this was too small and returned the area to Zhejiang. His hometown, Haozhou (modern-day Fengyang, Anhui), was first established as Lin Hao Prefecture, later renamed Zhongli Prefecture, and eventually became Anhui's Fengyang Prefecture. To ensure his hometown enjoyed the capital's status and imperial favor, it was incorporated into the Nanjing district. After Zhu Yuanzhang's death, the throne passed to his deceased son\u2019s heir, the grand prince Zhu Yunwen (Emperor Jianwen). Zhu Yuanzhang's fourth son, Prince Yan Zhu Di, was stationed in Beiping (modern-day Beijing), the former capital of the Yuan Dynasty. In the following year, 1399, Zhu Di rebelled under the pretext of \"Jingnan\" (pacifying the south), and by 1402, he had taken the capital. Emperor Jianwen died in a fire, and Zhu Di ascended the throne, becoming Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty. In the first month of 1403, Zhu Di officially renamed Beiping to Beijing and established the Shuntian Prefecture in February. He set up various governing bodies in Beijing and ordered the construction of palaces there in 1406. By 1409, Zhu Di personally moved to Beijing, leaving his son in Nanjing to govern. However, Zhu Di continued to travel back and forth between Beijing and Nanjing until 1417, when he finally left Nanjing for Beijing permanently. In 1420, he decreed that Beijing would become the capital, officially declaring the transfer of the capital from Nanjing to Beijing. The relocation of the capital to Beijing seemed natural, considering Zhu Di\u2019s long residence in Beiping and his military base there. Moreover, Beijing's location was strategic for confronting the remnants of the Yuan Dynasty in the north and preventing Mongol invasions. The decision proved to be a correct strategic choice, but why did the process take so long? The explanation in the early years could be the need for building infrastructure and palaces, but after that, the delay cannot be explained by conventional reasoning. In 1424, Zhu Di died on a military campaign, and his son, Emperor Renzong, ascended the throne. In 1425, he announced the relocation of the capital to Nanjing, and all Beijing departments were renamed \"xingzai\" (temporary capital). However, Emperor Renzong died shortly afterward, and his successor, Emperor Xuanzong, ruled for ten years, during which time Beijing remained the capital. It wasn\u2019t until 1441, during the reign of Emperor Yingzong, that the capital was officially confirmed as Beijing, and the departments were no longer called \"xingzai.\" From then on, the dual capital system remained in place until the fall of the Ming Dynasty. Nanjing continued to enjoy capital status, functioning almost identically to Beijing. The imperial palace and royal sites in Nanjing were preserved, and major state functions, such as ceremonies, decrees, and government announcements, were held simultaneously in both capitals or first in Beijing and then in Nanjing. The imperial punishment system also applied in Nanjing, where the local officials carried out punishments in the same manner as in Beijing. Nanjing maintained all administrative structures, but the officials there were largely ceremonial, symbolic, and non-executive, with no real power. For example, the \"Minister of Defense\" in Nanjing was essentially a ceremonial role with no actual duties. However, it was a comfortable position for officials who had fallen out of favor but couldn't be removed, such as the famous official Hai Rui, who was assigned to Nanjing as a ceremonial figure after his influence waned in Beijing.

Today, we all know that \"China\" (\u4e2d\u56fd) is the name of our country and an abbreviation for the People's Republic of China. But when did these two characters and the term they form first appear? What did they originally mean, and how did they come to represent our nation today? The story begins with an event that occurred in 1963. In August 1963, after heavy rains, a man named Chen, who rented a farmhouse in Jia Village, Baoji County, Shaanxi, noticed that part of a dirt cliff in the backyard had collapsed, revealing something shiny underneath. He dug it up with his hands and a small hoe and discovered a bronze vessel, which he took home. The following year, Chen moved back to Guyuan, entrusting the bronze artifact to another person for safekeeping. In 1965, that person, in need of money, sold the artifact to a scrap yard at the price of scrap bronze. A worker from the Baoji Museum happened to spot the artifact at the scrap yard and reported it to the museum director, who determined it was a valuable historical relic. The museum purchased the artifact, which was 38.8 cm tall, 28.8 cm in diameter, and weighed 14.6 kg, for 30 yuan\u2014the original price paid by the scrap yard. It became the first bronze artifact collected by the Baoji Museum since its establishment in 1958. In 1975, the Chinese National Administration of Cultural Heritage organized an exhibition of Chinese excavated artifacts in Japan to commemorate the normalization of China-Japan relations. Director Wang Yeqiu invited bronze expert Ma Chengyuan (later director of the Shanghai Museum) to prepare the collection. Among the 100 top-tier artifacts selected was the bronze vessel from Baoji, which featured intricate taotie patterns. While examining the artifact at the Palace Museum\u2019s Wuying Hall, Ma Chengyuan repeatedly wondered why such a large and elaborate piece had no inscriptions. Running his fingers over the inner base of the vessel, he sensed faint markings, prompting the team to remove the rust. Sure enough, beneath the mud and corrosion was a 122-character inscription arranged in twelve lines. Ma named the vessel the He Zun, as the inscription revealed that it had been made by an ancestor of the Zhou royal clan named He, to commemorate a reward of 30 cowries granted to him by the Zhou king. This artifact provides the earliest physical evidence of the term \"China\" (\u4e2d\u56fd). The inscription records how King Wu of Zhou, after defeating the Shang dynasty and capturing its capital, performed a grand ritual to report to Heaven: \"I have made 'China' my home and now govern its people.\" Based on the content of the inscription and its historical context, the He Zun was cast during the reign of King Cheng of Zhou, King Wu\u2019s son, around the late 11th century BCE. This means the term \"China\" appeared over 3,000 years ago, making it the earliest-known occurrence of the term outside of literary sources. What Did \"China\" Mean in Ancient Times? In this context, \"China\" referred specifically to the Shang dynasty's capital, the city where the supreme ruler of the Shang resided. But why was it called \"China\"? The term can be analyzed from its characters. In traditional Chinese, the character for \"\u56fd\" (country) includes the component \"\u53e3\" (mouth), symbolizing people, and a horizontal line beneath it representing the land they inhabit. The surrounding \"\u6208\" (dagger-axe) signifies defense of this territory. Over time, a \"frame\" was added to the character, symbolizing city walls, further emphasizing safety and protection. The character \"\u4e2d\" (center or middle) originally resembled a flag adorned with tassels, a symbol used by the Shang to rally troops and civilians. Over time, \"\u4e2d\" came to mean \"center\" or \"the most important place.\" Combining these meanings, \"\u56fd\" referred to a city-state, and \"\u4e2d\u56fd\" was the central or most significant state, often where the supreme ruler resided. The Evolution of \"China\" as a Concept Initially, during the Zhou dynasty, \"China\" referred to the central city or state where the ruler resided. However, as the Zhou king's authority diminished during the Eastern Zhou period, regional powers grew, leading larger states to adopt the term \"China\" for their own capitals. By the Warring States period, multiple regions considered themselves \"China.\" In 221 BCE, Qin Shi Huang unified the warring states, and his capital, Xianyang, became \"China\" in name and function. Over time, the term expanded to encompass the territories of successive centralized dynasties, symbolizing the political, geographical, and cultural heart of the empire. From the Han dynasty onwards, \"China\" became synonymous with the unified empire and its dominant Han culture. Neighboring regions and peoples were often labeled as \"barbarians,\" distinguishing them from the \"civilized\" center. Modern Usage of \"China\" Although the term \"China\" was used consistently throughout history, it was not an official dynastic name until the modern era. For example, the Qing dynasty officially referred to itself as \"Da Qing\" (Great Qing), not \"China.\" This changed with the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, when \"China\" became the official name of the state, a tradition that continues with the People's Republic of China today. Thus, while the term \"China\" has existed for over three millennia, its meaning and scope have evolved, reflecting the changing political, cultural, and geographic realities of the region. Historically, it symbolized legitimacy and centrality, essential for any regime claiming to represent the \"Middle Kingdom.\" Even non-Han rulers who sought to rule the region adopted the name to gain legitimacy, further embedding it into the nation's identity.","title":"Introduction: The term \"China\" appeared more than 3,000 years ago"},{"location":"history/The%20unchanging%20and%20the%20ever-changing/part_1_intro/#introduction-the-term-china-appeared-more-than-3000-years-ago","text":"Back to contents","title":"Introduction: The term \"China\" appeared more than 3,000 years ago"},{"location":"history/The%20unchanging%20and%20the%20ever-changing/part_1_intro/#when-did-the-name-china-first-appear","text":"Today, we all know that \"China\" (\u4e2d\u56fd) is the name of our country and an abbreviation for the People's Republic of China.

No-Goal This article does not offer any investment advice. The test configuration is only one possible scenario and may not reflect actual investment or living conditions. Test Setup Data The historical return of stocks, bonds and bills are taken from NYU . It covers the period from 1928 until 2023. I use S&P500 and T.Bond to refer to the columns S&P 500 (includes dividends) and US T. Bond (10-year) . Configuration The test configurations are: Assets are rebalanced at the start of each year. The risk factor is determined based on standard deviation. Initial expenses, when considered, are composed as follows: Rental: $2,000 per month (~\u00a31,525 per month, ~\u20ac1,811 per month) Other expenses: $2,000 per month Includes recurring expenses, e.g., grocery, utilities, transportation. Also includes one-off expenses, e.g., vacation. Total: $4,000 per month or $48,000 annually The minimal expense ratio is set at 75%. Inflation, though complex and varying across countries and time periods, is fixed at 2% to focus on allocation comparisons. Beware that it is a strong assumption. Expenses are deducted at the beginning of each year. Risk free rate is not considered. The initial expense and any expense calcualted in the succeeding years based on the inflation are called the full expense . The stated expenses are sufficient to support a comfortable lifestyle for a couple in low-cost countries such as Thailand or Spain. In the event of a market downturn, reducing expenses becomes one of the most effective strategies for financial survival. Theoretically, having no expenses allows for a quicker portfolio recovery than any positive expense level, as negative expenses would imply cash inflows into the investment. However, to maintain a reasonable quality of life, there must be a minimum level of expenditure at all times. This is where the minimal expense ratio comes into play, ensuring that expenses do not drop below a certain threshold. The actual expenses incurred will fall somewhere between this minimal level and the full, pre-determined expense amount. To determine the actual expense, the 4% rule is applied. Let \\pi represent the inflation, E_{f}^i represent the full expense of the i -th year, E_{f}^1 = $48,000 E_{f}^i = E_{f}^0 \\times (1 + \\pi)^{i - 1} , \\forall i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\} \\theta represent the minimal expense ratio, V^i_s represent the total value of asset at the beginning of the i -th year, V^1_s , the initial value, is a test variable and is discussed later in tests with expense, E_{a}^i represent the actual expense of the i -th year. The actual expense is calculated as: E_{a}^i = \\min\\left\\{E_{f}^i, \\max\\left\\{E_{f}^i \\times \\theta, V^i_s \\times 4\\%\\right\\}\\right\\} This formula ensures that expenses remain within a sustainable range, balancing between maintaining quality of life and preserving assets during market fluctuations. Periods Two types of periods are selected for analysis: sequential and random. Sequential periods consist of continuous historical time frames, allowing for an assessment of performance over actual historical trends. Random periods, on the other hand, are constructed by selecting and reordering historical returns randomly, without replacement, to simulate a variety of possible scenarios. Sequential Periods Three periods are tested: 1935 to 2023 This period represents the longest span following the 1929 Depression. Key reasons for selecting this timeframe include the establishment of the SEC in 1934 to regulate financial markets and the transformation of the Federal Reserve into a modern central bank. 2000 to 2015 This period marks the longest economic downturn in recent history. The market began its decline in 2000 and took until 2015 to fully recover, as measured by the S&P 500 index (excluding dividend reinvestment). 2000 to 2023 This timeframe encompasses a significant depression followed by the longest bull market in history. It serves as a test of the balance between risk and growth. Random Periods Three different period lengths\u201410, 15, and 20 years\u2014are tested, with 1,000 random samples taken for each. The samples are drawn from historical returns spanning from 1935 to 2023, inclusive. Metrics The following metrics are used: Annualized return Standard deviation of yearly return (risk) Annualized return per unit of risk Maximum drawdown Maximum drawdown duration Minimum asset value In tests involving expenses, the total actual expense is used as an indicator of living conditions. Performance Without Expense Sequential Periods The longest analyzed period spans from 1935 to 2023, encompassing 90 years. Over this extended timeframe, a high equity allocation consistently delivers better returns compared to portfolios with lower equity exposure. However, during shorter periods, the performance of a 100% equity allocation is not significantly superior to more diversified approaches, particularly in times of heightened volatility. The years from 2000 to 2015 represent the most volatile period among the three tested intervals. In this timeframe, a pure equity allocation not only produced the lowest returns but also carried the highest risk. Interestingly, an all-bond allocation during this period did not result in the highest return or the lowest risk, indicating that both extreme allocations\u2014whether fully in equities or entirely in bonds\u2014fail to offer adequate diversification benefits. Across all periods, portfolios with diversified allocations, combining both equities and bonds, exhibited the lowest risk, particularly when analyzed using return-per-risk metrics. The 100% equity allocation consistently produced the worst return-per-risk ratio, while the 40% equity allocation performed the best, followed closely by portfolios with 20% and 60% equity allocations. This supports the popularity of the 60/40 portfolio\u2014often advocated by books, financial articles, and advisors. The 60/40 allocation strikes a balance between different asset classes, offering a reasonable trade-off between return and risk. Its widespread endorsement is rooted in its ability to deliver stable and predictable results over various market conditions, making it a favored choice for long-term investors seeking both growth and protection. 1935 to 2023 Equity Return Risk Return/Risk Max Drawdown Max Drawdown Dration Min Net Asset 0% 4.65% 8.23% 0.57 21.46% 3 1000000 20% 6.18% 7.57% 0.82 17.87% 1 1000000 40% 7.56% 8.81% 0.86 17.91% 2 1000000 60% 8.79% 11.35% 0.77 20.82% 6 1000000 80% 9.87% 14.52% 0.68 28.86% 6 1000000 100% 10.80% 17.99% 0.60 37.43% 7 1000000 2000 to 2015 Equity Return Risk Return/Risk Max Drawdown Max Drawdown Dration Min Net Asset 0% 5.99% 8.99% 0.67 11.12% 2 1000000 20% 6.19% 4.71% 1.31 3.71% 1 1000000 40% 6.12% 4.60% 1.33 2.56% 2 1000000 60% 5.78% 8.81% 0.66 13.89% 2 894329 80% 5.15% 13.84% 0.37 25.22% 4 752520 100% 4.19% 19.05% 0.22 37.43% 6 625723 2000 to 2023 Equity Return Risk Return/Risk Max Drawdown Max Drawdown Dration Min Net Asset 0% 3.89% 9.25% 0.42 21.46% 2 1000000 20% 4.77% 6.94% 0.69 17.87% 1 1000000 40% 5.45% 7.35% 0.74 17.91% 2 1000000 60% 5.93% 10.15% 0.58 17.96% 2 894329 80% 6.18% 13.97% 0.44 25.22% 4 752520 100% 6.20% 18.18% 0.34 37.43% 6 625723 Random Periods Randomized tests reveal distinct patterns in investment metrics. First and foremost, annualized returns tend to benefit more from equity exposure as the investment time horizon lengthens. However, when investing for periods of 10, 20, or even 30 years, the return from a 100% equity portfolio is not significantly better than that of an 80/20 equity-to-bond allocation. This suggests that while equities generally drive long-term growth, a small portion of bonds can provide a more stable return without sacrificing much performance. A key observation, which holds across other metrics as well, is the instability of results over shorter timeframes. This is evident in the variability of returns, as demonstrated by the width of the bell curves for each time period. For instance, in a 10-year investment horizon, the return of a pure equity portfolio can range dramatically, from -10% to 30%. However, as the investment period extends to 40 years, the range narrows significantly, with returns typically falling between 2.5% and 17.5%. This highlights that, over longer durations, equity returns tend to become more predictable. Additionally, introducing bonds into the portfolio can further stabilize returns, mitigating the volatility seen with an all-equity approach. Risk follows a similar pattern to these findings from sequential period tests. As expected, the highest level of risk comes from an all-equity portfolio. However, contrary to what one might assume, the portfolio with the lowest risk is not the 100% bond allocation. Instead, diversified portfolios that combine equities and bonds effectively reduce risk. This supports the concept that diversification, by spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, plays a crucial role in risk mitigation. Annualized Return Risk (Standard Deviation) Return Per Risk Max Drawdown Max Drawdown Duration Minimal Net Asset Performance With Expense Sequential Periods Now, let's explore how these portfolio metrics affect real-life financial outcomes. The new metric, \"expense,\" represents how much money can be withdrawn from the portfolio over its lifetime. Simply put, the higher the expense amount, the better, as it allows for more spending without depleting the portfolio. Between 1935 and 2023, allocations ranging from 100% equity to 40% equity generated similar cash flows. Notably, the 80/20 portfolio (80% equity, 20% bonds) delivered almost the same cash flow as the 100% equity allocation, with a difference of less than 0.03%. This shows that reducing equity exposure slightly does not significantly impact the amount one can safely withdraw over time. However, during more volatile periods, such as from 2000 to 2015, higher equity allocations resulted in lower cash flows. The primary reason for this is that in a market downturn, expenses often need to be drastically reduced to preserve the portfolio's longevity. These reduced withdrawals also limit the portfolio\u2019s ability to recover when the market rebounds, as less money remains invested to benefit from the recovery. The period from 2000 to 2023 presents a different picture, featuring strong growth following a major market crash. While a 100% equity portfolio produced a similar annualized return to the 80/20 portfolio, the cash flow generated by the all-equity portfolio was nearly 10% lower than that of the 80/20. This highlights that even when equities recover well, the ability to withdraw cash consistently may be hindered by the need to cut expenses during downturns. In this period, the 60/40 portfolio (60% equity, 40% bonds) once again demonstrated its strength as a well-balanced allocation, performing favorably in terms of both cash flow and overall risk-return trade-offs. 1935 to 2023 Equity Return Risk Return/Risk Max Drawdown Max Drawdown Dration Min Net Asset Expense 0% 0.47% 7.90% 0.06 49.55% 49 489732 4177432 20% 2.06% 7.29% 0.28 22.31% 17 934501 9677595 40% 4.57% 8.76% 0.52 23.48% 8 952909 11484190 60% 7.07% 11.34% 0.62 31.63% 8 957867 11770148 80% 8.61% 14.44% 0.60 39.56% 8 947777 11803908 100% 9.76% 17.87% 0.55 47.30% 8 919102 11807333 2000 to 2015 Equity Return Risk Return/Risk Max Drawdown Max Drawdown Dration Min Net Asset Expense 0% 1.75% 8.63% 0.20 14.68% 6 960000 842156 20% 1.94% 4.53% 0.43 7.56% 2 960000 794206 40% 1.88% 4.42% 0.42 8.87% 3 893467 736243 60% 1.55% 8.46% 0.18 20.88% 7 759595 669737 80% 0.95% 13.29% 0.07 34.28% 13 630935 596647 100% 0.03% 18.29% 0.00 50.04% 14 479636 519342 2000 to 2023 Equity Return Risk Return/Risk Max Drawdown Max Drawdown Dration Min Net Asset Expense 0% -0.27% 8.88% -0.03 34.39% 14 903036 1208772 20% 0.58% 6.67% 0.09 22.68% 4 960000 1212533 40% 1.23% 7.06% 0.17 21.20% 3 893467 1195911 60% 1.69% 9.75% 0.17 21.24% 7 759595 1154907 80% 1.95% 13.43% 0.15 34.28% 13 630935 1083698 100% 1.96% 17.47% 0.11 50.04% 14 479636 988486 Random Periods The findings from random-period tests that include the \"expense\" metric reinforce the conclusions drawn from sequential-period analyses, as well as those from random periods without considering expenses. These tests consistently demonstrate the resilience of certain portfolio allocations across varying market conditions. When focusing on the expense metric, portfolios with equity allocations ranging from 40% to 100% provide similar cash flows across all investment time horizons. This suggests that, in terms of spending potential, higher equity exposure does not dramatically improve outcomes compared to more balanced portfolios. A diversified portfolio, such as the ones with 40% to 60% equity, not only delivers comparable cash flows but also offers another crucial advantage: a higher minimal net asset value. This higher minimal net asset value means that the portfolio maintains a larger financial cushion, which in turn reduces the risk of fully depleting the investment over time. By preserving more capital during downturns, these diversified portfolios are better positioned to sustain withdrawals without running the risk of draining assets entirely. This reduced risk makes diversified allocations like 40/60 or 60/40 especially appealing for long-term investors who seek both reliable cash flow and financial security.

Also includes one-off expenses, e.g., vacation. Total: $4,000 per month or $48,000 annually The minimal expense ratio is set at 75%. Inflation, though complex and varying across countries and time periods, is fixed at 2% to focus on allocation comparisons. Beware that it is a strong assumption. Expenses are deducted at the beginning of each year. Risk free rate is not considered. The initial expense and any expense calcualted in the succeeding years based on the inflation are called the full expense . The stated expenses are sufficient to support a comfortable lifestyle for a couple in low-cost countries such as Thailand or Spain. In the event of a market downturn, reducing expenses becomes one of the most effective strategies for financial survival. Theoretically, having no expenses allows for a quicker portfolio recovery than any positive expense level, as negative expenses would imply cash inflows into the investment. However, to maintain a reasonable quality of life, there must be a minimum level of expenditure at all times. This is where the minimal expense ratio comes into play, ensuring that expenses do not drop below a certain threshold. The actual expenses incurred will fall somewhere between this minimal level and the full, pre-determined expense amount. To determine the actual expense, the 4% rule is applied. Let \\pi represent the inflation, E_{f}^i represent the full expense of the i -th year, E_{f}^1 = $48,000 E_{f}^i = E_{f}^0 \\times (1 + \\pi)^{i - 1} , \\forall i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\} \\theta represent the minimal expense ratio, V^i_s represent the total value of asset at the beginning of the i -th year, V^1_s , the initial value, is a test variable and is discussed later in tests with expense, E_{a}^i represent the actual expense of the i -th year.

Over this extended timeframe, a high equity allocation consistently delivers better returns compared to portfolios with lower equity exposure. However, during shorter periods, the performance of a 100% equity allocation is not significantly superior to more diversified approaches, particularly in times of heightened volatility. The years from 2000 to 2015 represent the most volatile period among the three tested intervals. In this timeframe, a pure equity allocation not only produced the lowest returns but also carried the highest risk. Interestingly, an all-bond allocation during this period did not result in the highest return or the lowest risk, indicating that both extreme allocations\u2014whether fully in equities or entirely in bonds\u2014fail to offer adequate diversification benefits. Across all periods, portfolios with diversified allocations, combining both equities and bonds, exhibited the lowest risk, particularly when analyzed using return-per-risk metrics. The 100% equity allocation consistently produced the worst return-per-risk ratio, while the 40% equity allocation performed the best, followed closely by portfolios with 20% and 60% equity allocations. This supports the popularity of the 60/40 portfolio\u2014often advocated by books, financial articles, and advisors. The 60/40 allocation strikes a balance between different asset classes, offering a reasonable trade-off between return and risk.

First and foremost, annualized returns tend to benefit more from equity exposure as the investment time horizon lengthens. However, when investing for periods of 10, 20, or even 30 years, the return from a 100% equity portfolio is not significantly better than that of an 80/20 equity-to-bond allocation. This suggests that while equities generally drive long-term growth, a small portion of bonds can provide a more stable return without sacrificing much performance. A key observation, which holds across other metrics as well, is the instability of results over shorter timeframes. This is evident in the variability of returns, as demonstrated by the width of the bell curves for each time period. For instance, in a 10-year investment horizon, the return of a pure equity portfolio can range dramatically, from -10% to 30%. However, as the investment period extends to 40 years, the range narrows significantly, with returns typically falling between 2.5% and 17.5%. This highlights that, over longer durations, equity returns tend to become more predictable. Additionally, introducing bonds into the portfolio can further stabilize returns, mitigating the volatility seen with an all-equity approach. Risk follows a similar pattern to these findings from sequential period tests. As expected, the highest level of risk comes from an all-equity portfolio. However, contrary to what one might assume, the portfolio with the lowest risk is not the 100% bond allocation. Instead, diversified portfolios that combine equities and bonds effectively reduce risk. This supports the concept that diversification, by spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, plays a crucial role in risk mitigation.","title":"Random Periods"},{"location":"investment/asset-allocation/#annualized-return","text":"","title":"Annualized Return"},{"location":"investment/asset-allocation/#risk-standard-deviation","text":"","title":"Risk (Standard Deviation)"},{"location":"investment/asset-allocation/#return-per-risk","text":"","title":"Return Per Risk"},{"location":"investment/asset-allocation/#max-drawdown","text":"","title":"Max Drawdown"},{"location":"investment/asset-allocation/#max-drawdown-duration","text":"","title":"Max Drawdown Duration"},{"location":"investment/asset-allocation/#minimal-net-asset","text":"","title":"Minimal Net Asset"},{"location":"investment/asset-allocation/#performance-with-expense","text":"","title":"Performance With Expense"},{"location":"investment/asset-allocation/#sequential-periods_2","text":"Now, let's explore how these portfolio metrics affect real-life financial outcomes. The new metric, \"expense,\" represents how much money can be withdrawn from the portfolio over its lifetime. Simply put, the higher the expense amount, the better, as it allows for more spending without depleting the portfolio. Between 1935 and 2023, allocations ranging from 100% equity to 40% equity generated similar cash flows. Notably, the 80/20 portfolio (80% equity, 20% bonds) delivered almost the same cash flow as the 100% equity allocation, with a difference of less than 0.03%. This shows that reducing equity exposure slightly does not significantly impact the amount one can safely withdraw over time. However, during more volatile periods, such as from 2000 to 2015, higher equity allocations resulted in lower cash flows. The primary reason for this is that in a market downturn, expenses often need to be drastically reduced to preserve the portfolio's longevity. These reduced withdrawals also limit the portfolio\u2019s ability to recover when the market rebounds, as less money remains invested to benefit from the recovery. The period from 2000 to 2023 presents a different picture, featuring strong growth following a major market crash. While a 100% equity portfolio produced a similar annualized return to the 80/20 portfolio, the cash flow generated by the all-equity portfolio was nearly 10% lower than that of the 80/20. This highlights that even when equities recover well, the ability to withdraw cash consistently may be hindered by the need to cut expenses during downturns. In this period, the 60/40 portfolio (60% equity, 40% bonds) once again demonstrated its strength as a well-balanced allocation, performing favorably in terms of both cash flow and overall risk-return trade-offs.","title":"Sequential Periods"},{"location":"investment/asset-allocation/#1935-to-2023_1","text":"Equity Return Risk Return/Risk Max Drawdown Max Drawdown Dration Min Net Asset Expense 0% 0.47% 7.90% 0.06 49.55% 49 489732 4177432 20% 2.06% 7.29% 0.28 22.31% 17 934501 9677595 40% 4.57% 8.76% 0.52 23.48% 8 952909 11484190 60% 7.07% 11.34% 0.62 31.63% 8 957867 11770148 80% 8.61% 14.44% 0.60 39.56% 8 947777 11803908 100% 9.76% 17.87% 0.55 47.30% 8 919102 11807333","title":"1935 to 2023"},{"location":"investment/asset-allocation/#2000-to-2015_1","text":"Equity Return Risk Return/Risk Max Drawdown Max Drawdown Dration Min Net Asset Expense 0% 1.75% 8.63% 0.20 14.68% 6 960000 842156 20% 1.94% 4.53% 0.43 7.56% 2 960000 794206 40% 1.88% 4.42% 0.42 8.87% 3 893467 736243 60% 1.55% 8.46% 0.18 20.88% 7 759595 669737 80% 0.95% 13.29% 0.07 34.28% 13 630935 596647 100% 0.03% 18.29% 0.00 50.04% 14 479636 519342","title":"2000 to 2015"},{"location":"investment/asset-allocation/#2000-to-2023_1","text":"Equity Return Risk Return/Risk Max Drawdown Max Drawdown Dration Min Net Asset Expense 0% -0.27% 8.88% -0.03 34.39% 14 903036 1208772 20% 0.58% 6.67% 0.09 22.68% 4 960000 1212533 40% 1.23% 7.06% 0.17 21.20% 3 893467 1195911 60% 1.69% 9.75% 0.17 21.24% 7 759595 1154907 80% 1.95% 13.43% 0.15 34.28% 13 630935 1083698 100% 1.96% 17.47% 0.11 50.04% 14 479636 988486","title":"2000 to 2023"},{"location":"investment/asset-allocation/#random-periods_2","text":"The findings from random-period tests that include the \"expense\" metric reinforce the conclusions drawn from sequential-period analyses, as well as those from random periods without considering expenses.
