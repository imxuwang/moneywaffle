## Small Businesses Seek Alternatives to China Amid Rising Tariffs

- **Summary**: Many small-business owners in the U.S. are actively searching for supply chain alternatives to China due to existing tariffs increasing costs and new levies on the horizon. The uncertainty is further compounded by potential new tariffs on Mexican imports, which could disrupt plans to move production to Mexico. Businesses are considering options like sourcing from other countries or reshoring manufacturing despite higher costs and logistical challenges.

## Electric Vehicle Startups Face Cash Crunch

- **Summary**: At least a dozen startups specializing in electric vehicles (EVs) or battery technology are at risk of depleting their cash reserves by next summer, according to an analysis of recent financial filings. Despite growing interest in EVs, these startups are struggling with high development costs, production challenges, and intense competition from established automakers. Some companies have experienced significant stock price declines and are urgently seeking additional funding to sustain operations.
- **Implications**: The financial instability of these EV startups could lead to industry consolidation, project delays, or bankruptcies.
