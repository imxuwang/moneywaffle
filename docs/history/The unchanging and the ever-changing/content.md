# The Unchanging and the Ever-Changing


What Confucians call China, vast though it may seem,  
Is but one of eighty-one parts in the world's grand scheme.  
The "Divine Land of Red Counties" its noble name,  
Within it, nine provinces of ancient fame.  

Yu the Great once charted these lands with care,  
Yet beyond these borders, a world lies there.  
A fragment of the whole, though rich and proud,  
China’s place in the heavens is but one in the crowd.  

## Summary

Ge Jianxiong, a historian and senior professor at Fudan University, narrates the lifeblood and spirit of Chinese history, seeking the origins and flows of Chinese history amidst its rise and fall, inheritance, and transformation.

If we compare ancient China to a precise and vast collaborative system like the human body, then the land is its skeleton, the people are its flesh and blood, and the court and politics are its central nervous system.
The long history of China has continued and developed through their mutual influence and adaptation, ceaselessly thriving, shaping the China we know today.
