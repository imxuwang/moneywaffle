# Homeland: The Starting Points of Migration

*Back to [contents](./content.md)*

The large-scale migrations throughout Chinese history have left us with numerous roots, origins, and symbolic departure points for these movements, particularly those since the Ming and Qing Dynasties. For example, in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, many people claim their ancestral hometown as Xiaogan Township, Macheng, Huguang—modern-day Macheng City, Hubei Province. During the Ming Dynasty, Xiaogan Township was part of Macheng County. Many family genealogies state their origin as "Xiaogan Township, Macheng, Huguang," with some even referring to it as "Xiaogan Township, Macheng, Jiangxi." Remarkably, even some Yi families trace their ancestors back to Xiaogan Township, Macheng.

This migration history can be traced back to the late Yuan Dynasty, when Xu Shouhui led a rebellion in Macheng. Later, his followers entered Sichuan, and Ming Yuzhen established a regime in Chongqing, prompting some people to migrate from Huguang (a historical term encompassing modern Hubei and Hunan provinces) to Sichuan. During the Ming Dynasty, migration from Huguang to Sichuan continued, building on earlier waves of migration from Jiangxi to Huguang, encapsulated in the saying: "Jiangxi fills Huguang, and Huguang fills Sichuan." In the early Qing Dynasty, a large-scale migration called "Huguang Filling Sichuan" ensued, with further migrations extending into Yunnan, Guizhou, and southern Shaanxi.

In northern China, many people trace their roots to "Dahuaishu" (Big Locust Tree) in Hongdong, Shanxi. Family records and local chronicles frequently mention this origin, with some estimates suggesting that as many as 100 million people are descendants of Dahuaishu migrants. Hongdong is a county in Shanxi, but Dahuaishu is merely a symbolic tree—today’s tree being a replanting. Historically, after the wars of the early Ming Dynasty depopulated northern China, including the area around Beijing, the region needed to replenish its population. Shanxi, being less affected by the wars, became a source of migrants. While some indeed migrated from Hongdong, the tree itself became a collective memory for these migrations.

Another notable origin is Zhuji Lane in Nanxiong. Today, many people in the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong identify their ancestral home as Nanxiong Zhuji Lane. Descendants even maintain associations honoring Zhuji Lane, and genealogies and local chronicles frequently highlight this connection.

One theory attributes the migration to the "Hu Fei Rebellion" during the Southern Song Dynasty, when a concubine named Hu offended the emperor, leading to persecution of her family and the forced flight of Zhuji Lane residents. Another theory suggests the residents were descendants of Tang Dynasty officials who fled south due to war. Regardless, Zhuji Lane became the symbolic departure point.

There are many such symbolic departure points. For example:

- In Anqing, Anhui, many trace their origins to Waxieba in Jiangxi, believed to be near modern-day Poyang County.
- In northern Jiangsu, many claim Changmen in Suzhou as their ancestral home.
- In Huaibei, some trace their roots to Zaolinzhuang in Shandong, historically linked to the Wang Palace of Anqiu.
- In Yunnan, some families identify Yangliu Lane in Nanjing as their origin, though its precise location remains unclear.

Among these symbolic places, the most prominent are Xiaogan Township, Macheng; Dahuaishu, Hongdong; and Zhuji Lane, Nanxiong.

Given the scale of migration involving millions, how could so many people originate from a single village, lane, or tree? Historical records seldom document migrations that were not officially organized, leaving gaps in official and local histories. When examining historical facts, it becomes clear that such concentrated origins are logistically impossible. For instance:

- Migrants from Shanxi moving to North China or Beijing likely migrated directly without detouring south to Hongdong.
- The "Huguang Filling Sichuan" migration encompassed people not only from Hubei but also from Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Guangxi. It is improbable that all these migrants gathered in Macheng’s Xiaogan Township before heading to Sichuan.

In reality, these symbolic origins were shaped by collective memory and cultural significance. Early migrants, displaced by war or famine, often had no means to record their origins or migration paths. As their descendants gained wealth and status, they sought to compile genealogies that reflected respectability. Iconic places like Xiaogan Township, Zhuji Lane, or Dahuaishu became convenient symbols, chosen for their prominence and cultural resonance.

Some places became symbols due to distinct features or historical prominence:
- Hongdong’s Dahuaishu stood out as a landmark where some migrations began, anchoring it in collective memory.
- Zhuji Lane likely hosted a significant migration wave, reinforcing its role in cultural memory.
- Suzhou’s Changmen served as a hub for transportation and culture, making it a prestigious origin for those seeking to elevate their status.

Over time, these memories snowballed, with later generations adopting the same symbolic origins. This herd mentality perpetuated the myths, turning these locations into collective identities for immigrant descendants.

Not all departure points achieved such symbolic status. For example:
- Waxieba in Jiangxi is remembered by Wanjiang descendants, though its exact location remains obscure.
- Zaolinzhuang in Shandong, associated with Huaibei migrants, is similarly elusive.

These lesser-known origins reflect the complexity of migration memory. While other regions also contributed to migrations, their roles were overshadowed by the prominence of symbolic departure points.

Studying migration history requires analyzing cultural dissemination, local traditions, and folk customs to reconstruct the vivid stories behind these movements. While symbolic origins like Xiaogan Township, Dahuaishu, and Zhuji Lane dominate narratives, they often transcend historical accuracy. Instead, they represent the descendants’ emotional connection to their roots, ancestors, and shared history—a testament to the enduring importance of identity and heritage in Chinese culture.
