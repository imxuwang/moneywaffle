# Introduction: The term "China" appeared more than 3,000 years ago

##When Did the Name "China" First Appear?

Today, we all know that "China" (中国) is the name of our country and an abbreviation for the People's Republic of China.
But when did these two characters and the term they form first appear? What did they originally mean, and how did they come to represent our nation today? The story begins with an event that occurred in 1963.

In August 1963, after heavy rains, a man named Chen, who rented a farmhouse in Jia Village, Baoji County, Shaanxi, noticed that part of a dirt cliff in the backyard had collapsed, revealing something shiny underneath.
He dug it up with his hands and a small hoe and discovered a bronze vessel, which he took home.
The following year, Chen moved back to Guyuan, entrusting the bronze artifact to another person for safekeeping.
In 1965, that person, in need of money, sold the artifact to a scrap yard at the price of scrap bronze.

A worker from the Baoji Museum happened to spot the artifact at the scrap yard and reported it to the museum director, who determined it was a valuable historical relic.
The museum purchased the artifact, which was 38.8 cm tall, 28.8 cm in diameter, and weighed 14.6 kg, for 30 yuan—the original price paid by the scrap yard.
It became the first bronze artifact collected by the Baoji Museum since its establishment in 1958.

In 1975, the Chinese National Administration of Cultural Heritage organized an exhibition of Chinese excavated artifacts in Japan to commemorate the normalization of China-Japan relations.
Director Wang Yeqiu invited bronze expert Ma Chengyuan (later director of the Shanghai Museum) to prepare the collection.
Among the 100 top-tier artifacts selected was the bronze vessel from Baoji, which featured intricate taotie patterns.

While examining the artifact at the Palace Museum’s Wuying Hall, Ma Chengyuan repeatedly wondered why such a large and elaborate piece had no inscriptions.
Running his fingers over the inner base of the vessel, he sensed faint markings, prompting the team to remove the rust.
Sure enough, beneath the mud and corrosion was a 122-character inscription arranged in twelve lines.
Ma named the vessel the He Zun, as the inscription revealed that it had been made by an ancestor of the Zhou royal clan named He, to commemorate a reward of 30 cowries granted to him by the Zhou king.

This artifact provides the earliest physical evidence of the term "China" (中国).
The inscription records how King Wu of Zhou, after defeating the Shang dynasty and capturing its capital, performed a grand ritual to report to Heaven: "I have made 'China' my home and now govern its people."
Based on the content of the inscription and its historical context, the He Zun was cast during the reign of King Cheng of Zhou, King Wu’s son, around the late 11th century BCE.
This means the term "China" appeared over 3,000 years ago, making it the earliest-known occurrence of the term outside of literary sources.

##What Did "China" Mean in Ancient Times?

In this context, "China" referred specifically to the Shang dynasty's capital, the city where the supreme ruler of the Shang resided.
But why was it called "China"?

The term can be analyzed from its characters.
In traditional Chinese, the character for "国" (country) includes the component "口" (mouth), symbolizing people, and a horizontal line beneath it representing the land they inhabit.
The surrounding "戈" (dagger-axe) signifies defense of this territory.
Over time, a "frame" was added to the character, symbolizing city walls, further emphasizing safety and protection.

The character "中" (center or middle) originally resembled a flag adorned with tassels, a symbol used by the Shang to rally troops and civilians.
Over time, "中" came to mean "center" or "the most important place."
Combining these meanings, "国" referred to a city-state, and "中国" was the central or most significant state, often where the supreme ruler resided.

##The Evolution of "China" as a Concept

Initially, during the Zhou dynasty, "China" referred to the central city or state where the ruler resided.
However, as the Zhou king's authority diminished during the Eastern Zhou period, regional powers grew, leading larger states to adopt the term "China" for their own capitals.
By the Warring States period, multiple regions considered themselves "China."

In 221 BCE, Qin Shi Huang unified the warring states, and his capital, Xianyang, became "China" in name and function.
Over time, the term expanded to encompass the territories of successive centralized dynasties, symbolizing the political, geographical, and cultural heart of the empire.

From the Han dynasty onwards, "China" became synonymous with the unified empire and its dominant Han culture.
Neighboring regions and peoples were often labeled as "barbarians," distinguishing them from the "civilized" center.

##Modern Usage of "China"

Although the term "China" was used consistently throughout history, it was not an official dynastic name until the modern era.
For example, the Qing dynasty officially referred to itself as "Da Qing" (Great Qing), not "China."
This changed with the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, when "China" became the official name of the state, a tradition that continues with the People's Republic of China today.

Thus, while the term "China" has existed for over three millennia, its meaning and scope have evolved, reflecting the changing political, cultural, and geographic realities of the region.
Historically, it symbolized legitimacy and centrality, essential for any regime claiming to represent the "Middle Kingdom."
Even non-Han rulers who sought to rule the region adopted the name to gain legitimacy, further embedding it into the nation's identity.
