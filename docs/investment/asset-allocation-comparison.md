# Asset Allocation Comparison

## Asset Allocations

## Testing set up

### Data

The historical return of stocks, bonds and bills are taken from [NYU](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html).
It covers the period from 1928 until 2023.
I use `S&P500` and `T.Bond` to refer to the columns `S&P 500 (includes dividends)` and `US T. Bond (10-year)`.
